7,"I've seen the older movies of Mortal Kombat, and as cheesy and bad CGI as it was, the fights/tournaments, music, and plots were great. I was excited to see this new movie, and it wasn't that bad, but was still left unsatisfied. I was surprised that I fell in love with Kano; he was charming, hilarious, and prob the best character. Following him, I enjoyed SubZero and his fight scenes. Sonya Blade wasn't too bad too. One character that i had no interest in was the main guy, Cole. He was just boring and unnecessary. Even his ""power"" was....blah. I wish they had Liu Kang as the main guy, his story is more interesting. Another disappointment in this was the lack of tournaments in this movie, that was supposed to be the main plot of the whole movie. In addition, they did Goro dirty in this. His fight scene was short and missed the mark, and even though he was the big villain in the first movie, they showed him for less than 5 minutes in this one. Hopefully they bring him back somehow for a better fight in the 2nd movie. If they do, I'm excited to see my boy Johnny Cage!","positive"
7,"Great action and fight choreography as was to be expected from a movie with this title, special effects regarding characters and their abilities were also very well done especially considering the budget constraints this movie had. Storyline was predictable from the beginning and the writing itself isn't gonna win any awards, characters say their catchphrases from the games in key moments of the film, however, one big surprise for me was the character of Kano. He was the biggest and funniest comic relief character in the whole movie, constantly throwing jokes and insults at other characters. Probably one of the funniest, self aware movie characters I've seen in a long time.There are also weird editing jumps in the movie, one moment you're looking at characters interacting and in the next you're looking at something completely different. The movie suffers from a few of these, but given this is the directors first foray into the world of movie making, I'll take that L, most of the other important things were handled with care,If you know what you're getting and your expectations are right, this movie isn't gonna let you down with violence and gore, if you're expecting more then it's gonna be a letdown.","positive"
7,"I believe that I'm speaking for most fans when I say that I was expecting this to be loyal to the original storyline - a thought that the movie trailer ended right away. Instead we were presented with lots of deviations, and a sort of ""prequel"" that states a hope to build a cinematic universe around Mortal Kombat for the coming years, which don't get me wrong, is a very good thing. What I do think it's bad is the general acting - regarding some exceptions - along with character build up. Outworld characters appear to fall from the sky with little to no storyline attached to who they are and where they came from, when there was a lot to tell, especially about Shang Tsung, Mileena and Kabal. Actors playing Liu Kang, Kung Lao and particularly Raiden were close to average, along with their argument which was little to none. Kabal's voice was also not adequate to its figure. The guy's breathing through a metal mask and is stuck in an ""iron lung"" and sounds like a young wannabe highschool bully.Now the big elephant in the room, Cole Young. Adding a new character isn't that bad, but a new protagonist... that's an entire different thing. It's a very risky move, mostly because not only shatters the whole storyline, but also because a main character needs to be likeable to the general audience in order to stand. Personally, I found him closer to indifferent than good or bad, just kind of there. Fortunatly we can see that at the end, there's an intention to bring Johny Cage, who should already be present nonetheless along with Kitana (how can we have Mileena without Kitana?).Also there were some unecessary scenes, like Nitara (totally random choice by the way) literally appearing on screen just to die in the following second, following the footsteps of Rain in MK Anihalation. One way to get around that and other unsuited scene changes would be to increase the movie's lenght or simply not screening the character at all.On the upside, Kano's role is incredibly well performed and gives the movie its whole humour, bringing balance and a reality feeling to it. The fighting sequences are good, well shooted from a nice different set of angles, with a lot of movement variety. It's also noticeable they gave enourmous attention to Sub-Zero's special effects, which I think is one the best things in the movie along with some easter eggs like Shinnok's Amulet or Kitana's Fan. Goro's animation is also on a good note.Last but not least, the final standoff between Scorpion and Sub-Zero didn't let down. Very well shooted with an original choreography, and still managing to be loyal to some of the most iconic original moves from the game characters.To summarize, it's a generally well done remake. Although needing a lot of work, mostly on actor's performance and argument, has potential to set the foundations for an upcoming cinematic universe to be explored, which after all these years, MK absolutely deserves.","positive"
7,"I enjoyed MK overall, it was funny, action packed and generally quite faithful as an adaptation. The acting was also really good, with Joe Taslim as Subzero being the highlight for me. I was very disappointed however with the lack of an actual tournament, the fights were either ambush's or quick come and go brawls, there was no structure or rules, which I expected for the first mortal Kombat movie.I also didn't gravitate towards the newcomer Cole, I felt like he was unnecessary, I understand wanting to do your own thing sometimes but this was not one of those times. He also beats an iconic MK character which rubbed me the wrong way, but hopefully we'll see them again. The opening is brilliant and the second act is solid, but it's final act is very rushed and leaves you with little time to take it all in. Pretty good but not what I was hoping for.","positive"
7,"I believe I was 12 years old when the first Mortal Kombat came out at the arcades, I would stand in lines meticulously destroying my competition. Watching this movie brought back memories that I hadn't thought about since I was young . To make this short, The nostalgia was perfect, they had all the old champions with a few new mixed in..The beginning was awesome, I really thought it was going to be a different Mortal Kombat movie, However, the beginning is the only drama you see after that its all fights. WHICH WERE AWESOME, but for people looking to see some sort of drama or decent script writing it falls very short.","positive"
10,"I am not quite sure why many are going into this movie expecting some ""Grade A"" writing and pacing. This is literally a Mortal Kombat movie you know what you are going to get and it gave what was needed good entertainment and fighting and brutality. I didn't start up Mortal Kombat on my HBOMax expecting some amazing award-winning plot or writing I came for the fights and characters. I am not sure what a lot were expecting out of this its Mortal Kombat lol also the fight choreography was really well done I am not sure what in the world some are talking about.Entertaining movie and pretty much what I expected.","positive"
10,"I can say that I loved every part of the movie, even the boring parts, the story wasn't bad, although I would prefer to have Cole as a secondary character other than the main character, Would prefer to have more ninjas in the movie,(Scorpion, Subzero, Ermac, Reptile, Rain, Smoke, Noob, Jade, Kitana) but I wasn't mad about it, (well maybe reptile, I would prefer a more human reptile with powers than a actual reptile)The lack of Johnny Cage I can understand, he has a BIG personality to be introduced in a movie with so many characters, I gladly welcome him in the sequel.Kano was... Kano. The actor got 100000% the personality. I honestly couldn't think of a better portrait of the character. ON POINT! KUDOS Josh Lawson.Kung Lao and Jax were another great characters. The rest was a bit generic to be honest. But it was corny and entertaining, everything I wanted from MK.There were things that were a bit rushed like some way characters got their inner power. But all in all it was entertaining and great.Waiting patiently for a sequel.","positive"
10,"Have been playing the game since MK1. Legacy must go on.","positive"
10,"AMAZIIIIIING need the sequel and more characters :D.","positive"
10,"I'm by no means a Mortal Kombat expert but it was one of my favorite games to play as a kid, back on a Super Nintendo! <U+0001F633> But I have also enjoyed playing the newer MK games on newer devices as well. The games now are very graphic, and the movie delivers on that as well. I love that the characters say lines from the game like ""Flawless Victory"" and ""Kano wins!"" I really don't understand why anyone watching it would be upset with that. Have you guys ever even played the game? Kano was hilarious. I did want a little more from Mileena. Scorpion and Sub Zero were amazing! Great fight scenes! I'd definitely recommend this movie.","positive"
10,"Love the movie I hope they keep making more to come and they r amazing.","positive"
10,"Finally my home theater paid back. I didn't feel that pumped up since 2006 when I first saw the Transformers. And once the movies open after quarantine, I'll go twice lol.","positive"
10,"Here's hoping for a couple möte!I was entertained!","positive"
10,"I got a movie effort on what I expected. Yeah a video game. At least it had substance and is willing to go further bc there are more characters. But it established a basis. And was willing to show more.","positive"
10,"I see alot of other reviews saying that there wasn't a need for Cole and this and that. But I thought I was fantastic! I've been a fan of MK since the release of the 1st game. And everything done up to this point has been sub par to say the least. This movie, while yes having some cheese here and there and a couple plot holes and could've done this or that, I feel was a great story and very well executed. And for the addition of Cole. MK has introduced new characters all the time!. So why not introduce a new one? Especially one that helps tell the story and explain how this or that happens? Haha. All in all. I love it! Above and beyond better than the 1st 2 live action MK movies!!","positive"
10,"I belive with sequals it Will get better the story part.","positive"
7,"I don't really play Mortal Kombat or even follow the concept behind it. But even so, I enjoyed this movie. The fighting choreography is top notch! The costume, the cgi is also worth the hype. I love that they decided to make it rated R. But there's also some things that bothered me, like some bad cinematography, cheesy dialogues, and the somehow boring protagonist. The act 3 of the movie really felt rushed like the writers only had 5 minutes left to finish the script. I hope the sequel will have a better act 3.","positive"
10,"When scorpion says ""get over here"" and the mortal kombat music starts playing, that gave me chills!!!! I hope we do get the trilogy, seeing your childhood on the screen is always perfection.","positive"
10,"Oh, Mortal Kombat. I just loved these games as a kid... I still love them. I now can happily be cut in MK3 for the Sega or MK9 on PC. And when I learned about the existence of a film adaptation of this wonderful fighting game, I immediately decided to watch it. And you know, this movie captivates from the first seconds. As soon as they start to play the first chords of the legendary melody, you just blows the tower. The plot, though rustic, but quite decent. The characters are transferred quite reliably, though some of them are inserted into the film only for the sake of fan service, such as Scorpion or Sub-Zero. The plot revolves around the main trio of the series - Liu Kang, Sonya Blade and Raiden, who must defeat all their enemies and save the world. A little trite, but it is more than overlapped just beautiful battle scenes. The main villain of the film Shang Tsung performed by Chin Han came out very charismatic and memorable. In a whole the film highly good, albeit not without shortcomings. And separately I will allocate Goro whose model was made so that sometimes there was a feeling of its full realism. From me movie 10/10.","positive"
10,"As an old fart, I was surprised at how engaging this new take was. The 1995 version was good fun and this effort maintains the rage. The right mix of kung fu & fantasy. Plenty of laughs, gore, & deliciously cheesy, heartfelt moments.","positive"
10,"People on here really like""The plot wasn't coherent enough for me.""
""The acting performances didn't move me enough.""B**ch Sub Zero stabbed a dude with an ice pick, froze his gushing blood to form another weapon, and stabbed him with it again! Please people try to understand what you're coming to see a movie for before you see it.","positive"
10,"Violent and gory, just like the game! Non stop action. Great fights and a ton of blood. Nicely paced and I love that it harkens to parts of the game. You'll love it!","positive"
7,"The good: the story mostly works, the characterizations are insanely good (from costumes to personalities), and the movie is as gory and brutal as needed, actually way funnier than expected, and the CGI for the powers really great.The bad: the story is a bit messy, the characters motivations and reactions not always 100% natural and/or coherent, and the action and fights (with the exception of the ones with Scorpion) are fine, but the choreography and/or filming is kind of weak (easy to improve with a bigger budget and more talent on board).","positive"
10,"As a young child I loved the original movie! Watching it last night with my son, reminded me how great these fight scenes are. My son kept wanting more and when characters performed their moves and fatalities, he kept jumping out of his seat. Story could have been better but I see it's for the sequel (I hope they make soon). If you love action, this movie is for you!","positive"
10,"Amazing! Everything is excellent and great!I thought that it would be medium, but it was excellent.","positive"
10,"I see a lot of people talking about the lack of certain things like the actual tournament, to much groundwork on background for certain characters and other characters completely missing from the movie, characters not looking the same etc, as well as people saying they wish there had been more action than only about 40-50% of the movie.I just want to point out to everyone that is not aware, that this is supposed to be the beginning of a trilogy (Yes, I am one of those people that follows stuff like that). Had they packed all of that into one movie it would have been overload.I personally think it was an excellent start! Excellent character casting and personality building on everyone. I love all the visual, Outworld and the temple on Earth. As well as all the visual hints in the movie of future character's for those of us that are a little obsessive.I like the music upgrades, they still have the feel of the original and bring back memories with a slightly more contemporary vibe to keep it from sounding dated. Crossing my fingers that this first installment does well enough so that the next installment goes ahead. The only reason that I am worried that it may not is because of everything thats happened over the past year, not because of the movie not being good enough.I personally loved this movie, as the first of a trilogy. If it were a stand alone I may be a little disappointed that certain personal favorites *cough* Katana *cough* Nightwolf *cough* were not in it, however, I saw Katana's blade fan in the temple although it didn't get a neon sign the way Shinnok's amulet did when Kano tried to steal it, and one of the newspaper clippings on Sonya Blade's research wall pointed to a possibility for a future Nightwolf to me. But between those hints and the big hint (blazing neon sign really lol) at the end when Cole Young heads to Hollywood and as he leaves a movie poster for Johnny Cage as Citizen Cage is left in focus of the camera spell out for some excellent future possibilities/probabilities. They would have had to include other realms in this movie to pull in characters like Katana and again, that probably would have been information overload for one movie. They are taking their time and doing this right and I for one appreciate it greatly!Looking forward to the next installment of this trilogy!","positive"
10,"True adaptation of the game. Fun movie to watch. Kano was absolute blast.","positive"
10,"THE MOVIE DELIVERS ON WHAT IT PROMISES, A LOT OF ACTION, A LOT OF BLOOD AND A LOT OF FIGHTING. THOSE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE WITH A COMPLICATED AND SOPHISTICATED PLOT KEEP GOING, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU.","positive"
7,"Plot was lacking but the violence, gore and fighting choreography made up for it. The editing was a bit choppy and lacked in arrears that needed more detail. With all that being said, it was overall enjoyable if you're an MK fan.","positive"
10,"There were many moments where I was clapping in the theatre and the rest of the audience joined in!!! Flawless victory!!!I got goosebumps watching it. So many great moments!!If you love the games, you won't be disappointed. This is now my favorite movie of all time.","positive"
10,"Iam a big fan of this franchise since my childhood . Watched and played the game and movie as well in childhood. The movie was fantastic great story telling , great action . Was hooked to the movie from the start . Warner bros did a great job with this movie . Awesome characters in this movie . Specially loved subzero and scorpion . They also set up the movie for sequels hopefully guys we get a sequel soon .","positive"
9,"The movie lives up to the expectation. Delivered great CGI effect. Looking forward to the next sequel.","positive"
9,"The movie is great . After all you are not gonna watch some sort of Genesis movie . It has all the action , blood and everything that you want from a MK movie .YEP , the editing was not so good , but will see hows gonna be in the second movie. Hope we see it : )","positive"
7,"Big expectations, but althought it could be better, at least is watchable. Not too much fighting, less than 50% of the game. Spoiler alert!! Theres also second part upcoming.","positive"
9,"I have watched the original movie & treat this as a standalone version.9/10The fights are epic, bloody, gory & Mortal Kombat-esque. Exactly what Dr Goro ordered!Cool story, excellent special effects & decent actors.Highlights include an awesome soundtrack, one character with hilarious dialogue & game references.Must see! Fight!!","positive"
9,"Ignore those low reviews, they probably just dont understand the game and concept. It's a throwback style movie for those old skool gamers.They done it better the way they set the story.","positive"
8,"I was worried the first scene would be the pinnacle of the movie, and while it was.... Hanzo Hasashi made my movie year with three words and his reappearance. He's always phenomenal. The rest of the movie was lots of fun with minor disappointments. I hope they make the follow up.","positive"
7,"Pretty legit, solid. Had a good time watching.Wished it was longer with more action scenes. Otherwise, totally legit and would totally watch this one again.","positive"
8,"Good martial arts, action and fun, it won't disssapoint you.Back to the 80s!","positive"
9,"SPOILERS........Personally I thought the movie was pretty steller the action, comedy, and the effects were all wonderful. Now the only few grips I had with it was general reiko I felt that he was over acting way too much (which is weird for a guy with no lines to do), the main character wasn't an established mk character (would have loved it if lu kang was the focus but the lead character kinda grew on me so it's only a minor issue), and finally how sonya got her powers. The hole training montage was based around finding their arcana and it being difficult but she was able to get it the second she beat kano (rip best character)","positive"
8,"I'm giving a 8 cause I was waiting this movie since the announcement but I'm a little disappointed cause I thought that Scorpion will be on Quan Chis hand and I was hoping for more characters like some of Netherrealm characters. But is a movie that for us as MK lovers should not miss.","positive"
8,"Somewhat cartoonish as one would expect. Slightly miscast, but it works for this movie. All and all a good one to view.","positive"
8,"I actually quite enjoyed watching this movie! The action was awesome, the jokes were actually funny, and the storyline was fairly well developed. The main characters were badass, and the CGI was stunningly good. I went in with no expectations and was rewarded with a good time. Finish them!","positive"
6,"I like the brutal fight scenes and the actors chosen for the characters. Unfortunately, the battles were often very short and characters killed quickly, some of which should never have been in a pre-tournament movie. This movie felt pointless and the addition of Cole is not necessary. Just make Cole die next movie and bring Scorpion back. That's the only way this trilogy works. The new character Cole is so annoying and not even a real MK fighter so what's the point.","negative"
7,"A beautiful movie that brings back joyful memories
But Scorpion's role was small
And the scenes of fighting and karate should be stronger and more.<U+0001F982>","positive"
8,"As a fan of the games for 29 years this was a great alternate timeline PREQUEL to the first Mortal Kombat game which was is fought on Shang Tsungs island (hopefully in the sequel)Do characters die off early yes, but just like the games no one is truely dead in the MK universe.Look up ""MK revernants.""I like how everyone is training to unlock their powers and the fight scenes that are video game accurate, the humour and fatality's were all a FLAWLESS VICTORY!Check it out.","positive"
3,"Why? Why did they make this? As an avid Mortal Kombat fan since day 1 I can say that this movie was trashy baggins. Cole Young? Who? This guys special power is to magically grow a long sleeve shirt. Notice he isn't on the theatrical one sheet... BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS WHO THIS GUY IS. Don't make up stuff.I'll give praise to the special effects but, overall, this movie felt like a pilot for a CW tv show. Liu Kang has a slight british accent. Why? Shirt McGirt can defeat the 9 times running MK champ after getting his hiney wiped at the beginning of the movie by a nobody. Why? So much no. Just so much no.","negative"
9,"I enjoyed this tremendously. I got what i wanted. Fast paced non stop action.Some top notch editing, amazing cinematography n amazeballs special effects.No hand held shaky stuff, nothing shot in the dark n no time wasting.The film has oodles of blood and it has one of the best watermelon exploding scene via the mighty clap.The effects of Reptile n Goro is very well done.The only thing i missed is the theme song n the screaming of Mortallll Kombatttt.But i am happy that they retained the iconic dialogues, ""your soul is mine"" and ""flawless victory "".They shud have taken Iko Uwais too.","positive"
8,"It's true there's not much storyline & character development going on, because there's no need. It's an ACTION film. You give a little pieces of characters background and the main focus should be on action. The fighting scenes and visual effects are great although some of them could be improved to perfect. Never a dull moment for me. I highly recommend.","positive"
7,"Brought out all the 90s kid feels. Not sure why some reviews are so low. Fight scenes were great, special effects were great, story was serviceable. It's not going to win an oscar, but i feel like they did a great job with this adaptation. Hope they include Kitana in the sequel.","positive"
7,"I thought this was a very enjoyable movie. Great battles, lots of our favorite MK characters and really cool looking fatalities. Kano stole the show. He had so many ""LOL"" moments. They nailed the characters in general but they failed miserably with the main character..He was not prepared for a main role. His powers were weak. He ruined the epic battle between Subzero and Scorpion. Imo they could've had something much better without this character. Thumbs up nonetheless.","positive"
9,"The movie was great and piece of art. The direction was amazing. Vfx grapics and etc...was also great but the problem was that some parts of the movie were without substitiles and were not understandable..","positive"
9,"To summarize: this movie accomplishes what it intended to. It's a more graphic, modern, and cinematic take on the games content. It builds a loose plot line to allow for multiple fights while essentially serving as a prologue to future potential sequels or movies.Pros:
Graphic content, Delivers what you expect, Scorpion Vs Sub-Zero driving the plot line, easy to follow, multiple fights, and distinguishes itself from old movies.Cons:
Struggled to create a climatic fight sequence like old films where they progressed to a boss, cussing was ok but almost became unnecessary at times like it was being forced, acting took some time to adjust to, fights weren't very long (but did allow for more), and missed out on the epic fight music keying in at the right times.Final thoughts:
It's a movie converted from a game and should be treated as such. Not-so-serious entertainment that gives exactly whats expected of if with room to flourish with sequels and etc if properly managed. The story behind Cole young surprisingly didn't suck either and neither did the movie as long as you keep it in perspective of what exactly it is (a gaming fans movie).","positive"
7,"It is a Mortal Kombat movie, so nobody expects a cinematic masterpiece but rather a fun martial arts movie with fun fighting scenes and cool special effects. That being said; this movie nails it but it still needs polishing in that area. The fighting is the centerpiece of this movie, but some shots and cuts take that away a bit too often and makes you go from ""holy cow"" to ""what was that?"" a bit too much. This is especially sad since not only the special effects were great but so are the fighting choreographies, and the editing overshadows the amazing actors' work.On the other hand this movie presented some cheesy and awkward moments script-wise, having some noticeable plot holes and basic dialogues, but it also delivers great performances; mainly from Josh Lawson (Kano).In conclusion: when you walk in wanting to watch a Mortal Kombat movie you know what you're going to get. And while this movie needs some polishing to be done in its editing and writing in its essence is actually a great movie... or rather a... Flawless Victory!","positive"
7,"Let's set the expectations first. This movie is based on a video game, not a book or a comic. If you are going into the movie expecting an Oscar winning script or Oscar performances from actors, then you will be disappointed.If you are hoping for a decent screenplay based on the video game with good fight scenes, screen adaptions of your favourite characters and improved choreography and CGI compared to previous Mortal Kombat movies, then you will enjoy this movie. Based on those criteria and scoring this movie from an entertainment point of view, I would give it an 7/10 - I would have loved to have heard the original theme from the 1995 movie in this.I personally didn't have high expectations for this movie due to the fact that very few video games have had good screenplay adaptions. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the job the producers have done for this movie.Although I did not know some of the actors, I thought the casting of the characters was perfect and loved seeing the job they did with them. I especially loved the screen adaptions of the characters special moves... they were a joy to behold. Kano was also surprisingly very funny and the producers did a great job including some of the characters catchphrases. The fictional worlds were also impressive looking in the movie.If you are a fan of the Mortal Kombat game, and you enjoyed the 1995 movie, then this movie is definitely for you. If you are looking for a cheesy entertaining movie to watch then you can't really go astray either with this. If neither of those scenarios apply to you then you should probably give this a miss.","positive"
7,"Pretty decent for people who played the original games and saw the early films it's very nostalgic.Hope if another film gets made will show the actual tournament but its a fun film.","positive"
8,"It is a great movie with good graphics. The team did a lot of work.All the finishers were present.It is perfect but if you watched Scorpion's Revenge, don't make a conclusions.Scorpion doesn't look great.","positive"
10,"Test your might! All I can say is...can't wait for part 2!!!","positive"
8,"Was this a great movie? No. Was this a good movie? Also, probably, no. Alright... let's be honest, this was a bad movie. But it was a great MORTAL KOMBAT movie.Full disclosure, I'm a big fan of the Mortal Kombat franchise. I've been playing the video games since the 90's and I am 100% the target demographic for this movie. If you are like me, you will enjoy the movie. If you are not like me, you probably won't (nor should you).Watching the movie is like you're experiencing a playthrough of a new MK game on story mode. All dialogue just serves as a filler between fight scenes. I love the hard R rating that allows the film to embrace the brutality of the violence that is the signature of the series.There are a ton of nods throughout the film to insider fans.Again, in summation: not a good movie. But a GREAT Mortal Kombat movie. Take that for what you will.","positive"
6,"Great visuals, excellent fight scenes, good choices on most of the cast (e.g Kano, Scorpion, Sub-Zero) and just a fun movie overall. If you are familiar with the game, you will like it.Keep in mind that it's a trilogy, so this first film tries to add some background! Luckily there's not much time spent on meaningless conversations and the scenes get into the action parts faster than you would expect. Runtime of 1h 50min is works well; you will not be bored.Fight scenes get more rewarding halfway through, closer to the game style.Also, the idea to rotate this film's story around the rivalry between scorpion and sub-zero worked; it gave some background. Maybe the lead protagonist is not that interesting compared to the other characters but he seems necessary to keep the story moving forward.So, this first film does the job and although not everyone from the game is in it, I m sure all the other favorite characters will appear in the next 2 films and I m looking forward to that.6,5/10 good effort bringing the game on film screen.","negative"
9,"It's fun, a little dumb but not in a bad way.The fight choreography is amazing and the effects are better than most blockbusters (Godzilla vs Kong I'm looking at you).It's good, I enjoyed it a lot.","positive"
8,"Could this movie have been better? For sure. Are the characters fun? Yes. Are the fight scenes good? Absolutely. I would've liked a couple more ninja scenes worked in. I feel the ninja genre is under served and there's a ripe opportunity to bring it back. And of course they had two of the coolest ninjas ever at their disposal.","positive"
8,"I'll try to say as little as possible so no spoilers.I, personally wanted to watch it and changed my mind the first time going to a theater as I read some reviews here. I'm glad I changed my mind again and went to see it.I enjoyed the whole movie,and looking forward to next one. The negative reviews mostly say couple of things : 1 bad acting 2 not enough action..
Well firstly it's not an oscar reaching drama so for acting - acting was fine, all characters were in their style and some even better than expected.The movie has plenty of action but you gotta keep in mind that it's clearly made to be continued soon, so this film gives a nice welcome to MK world. Well balanced story good action and def fun MK fights....these reviewers must have lost the love for MK world, but it's easier to criticize the movie vs recognizing that they too old for this .lol..Ignore negative reviews, go watch it and enjoy.","positive"
8,"I really enjoyed the fights,the dialogues, and the customs, looking forward for the next movie.","positive"
8,"Gory just like the source material. Not the best storyline I've ever encountered, but certainly better than expected.I went in with low expectations and I'm glad to say I was surprised. Considering whats coming out these days, this was one of the more enjoyable movies I've watched over the last year.","positive"
8,"I am not big fan of the game but the movie was entertaining for me. It had great action and fight choreography along with good special effects. Characters and their abilities were also very well done.The main problem with the movie was that storyline was predictable from the beginning. The plot could have been better. Expectations go high when studio takes 20 years to make a reboot. Overall, a total enjoyment (if you watch it without high expectations).","positive"
8,"The movie was ok for a fun watch in theaters.(Something that's quite a feat to accomplish, considering we are in the middle of a pandemic.... never thought I'd ever have to write that but here we are.)It doesn't need a long review. If you need to have the movie be so accurate, you're better off playing the video games.And even the video games contradict themselves, most prominently since MK 10, where it seems they have gradually discredited MK: Deception, Sub Zero Mythologies, MK: Armageddon and some aspects of MK9.Although, the movie follows in the vein of MK9 and humanizes the plot by adding a new character, complete with some backstory and background.No new ground was broken with character development and it doesn't need to when we have played the 20 different games there are on the subject.The fatalities and gore FINALLY have made it onto the big screen and for that, I commend the filmmakers and their ear for fan service.The dialogue was less contrived than the first 2 movies and the witty Kano, who is usually despised by your average MK fan, was a delightful surprise.He really helped move the already awkward dialogue and deadpan performances along.For me, it was worth the ill advised trip to the theater. I do believe there's plenty of room for improvement but hopefully, the obviously hinted at sequel will take the movie where it needs to be, but for now, it was a good beginning and a fun, slightly nostalgic experience.","positive"
8,"I found the film quite entertaining with a very different storyline. The movie felt short although it is about 2hrs long. Lots of action with cool fight scenes and blood. The addition of cole can be a hit and a miss or first base depending on how the storyline for the film is developed. As a fan of the game and movies other than the cgi Gorro i caught myself enjoying the movie unravel. Id say if your an mk fan you will enjoy the fight scenes along with the fighters move set combinations. I give it a thumbs up!!","positive"
8,"I have seen alot of negative reviews about the film but if your a fan of the game you need to watch it. The main character is not as bad as people are making out and the plot is a stepping stone for an expansive franchise. I'm not going to say much about the story as you can read the synopsis so no spoilers. Please don't listen to the negative reviews as me and my wife really enjoyed it and can't wait for the sequel. Everyone is entitled to there opinion so watch it and hopefully you enjoy it as much as we did.","positive"
7,"Like breaking out the Nintendo and reliving some childhood memories. It's not earth shattering writing - but it does what it's intended to do, serve up some great nostalgic (and sometimes bloody) fight scenes.","positive"
8,"How did they keep making PG-13 movies out of a video game that involves ripping people's spines out? Well, they finally got it right with the blood and gore. The story was a little weak but I'll forgive it, as my 14-year-old inner self was rejoicing throughout!","positive"
8,"By FAR the best movie of a video game licence. This is surely not a great movie, but if you like Mortal Kombat games franchise, you sure won't be dissapointed by it.Great visual effects, the movie don't take itself too seriously, lot of gore and violence and lot of characters made a appearance.If you don't like/know the franchise, it sure won't be the same.On a more personal note, I very dislike that Mortal Kombat theme remix on the end credits.","positive"
9,"People are giving this movie too much flack because they don't udnerstand the premise. This movie isn't the tournament - It's a precursor to the tournament. It's a fight to lead into the tournament. Given a sequel happens that's what we'll see. It was made clear even in the beginning of the film there will be no tournament...","positive"
7,"It's actually great, with the history of this.The fight is totally awesome, it's very outstanding when see Sub-Zero use his ice.But, I think, the story still need more, because it's feel too forced to be 2 hours.","positive"
8,"It is a great movie with a lots of action and and the characters are great and I think the Actors Did a good job in the movie and most of it was really great but there is some couple things wrong with the movie like not a lot of characters from the game like reptile,shao kahn,meat, rain they were not in the movie which I don't like And spoiler warning! Another thing I don't like about it is it does not have any after the Credits there was no scene explaining Johnny cage it could've been awesome if they do that it could've been the perfect ending for Mortal Kombat movie and announce the sequel and over all my opinion on the movie I think it was action packed I think it was like the video game if you like video games you will love this movie a lot And if you like action movies you will love this movie I highly recommend it to anyone who is a diehard video game fan and I think the movie was great.","positive"
7,"I hated the plot the main character was a terrible addition the setup for the next movie was kinda cheesy as well. The intro was just amazing i did overall enjoy the movie but it was not as good as it could have been. Too much backstory that they made up instead of using the source material.","positive"
8,"If you go to see Godzilla vs Kong you want gain fights ; if you go to see Mortal Kombat you want bloody combats to dead.","positive"
7,"I thought the begining of the movie would lead to a champion who was directly trained and raised by raiden. Not sure what happend to the kid instead we will have his grand kid maybe? Which is aloser which being push as a leader of groups of champion. Which is weird as i always see liukang as one of the grup leader. Other than subzero vs scorpion fight everything else needs improvement (alot), as the cover shows subzero and scorpion the fight scene between the two saves the beginning and the ending fights from dissapointment. This movie can lead to an interesting franchise.","positive"
8,"This is exactly what it's supposed to be...
Some reviews claiming to be 27 year vets of MK and wish they had more deep character arcs and a more meaningful story.Play the game, then watch the film....... the director said he wanted to stay loyal to the game and its roots, and in alot of ways they did.Kano provides comedy relief in buckets, not forced humour or politically charged comments, honestly I was howling at some of his one liners. The scorpion and Sub Zero storyl line is brilliant and a great centre stage for an MK movie. Loads of gore, loads of fights and lots of everything in between.This film is based on a fighting game where you rip people's spines out then meet then again later. Remember not to take this film too seriously and you'll have a blast.","positive"
7,"Faithful to the game as far as fatalities go. Faithful to the Sub-Zero and Scorpion rivalry. Action packed, great fighting choreography, acting was good. What it lacked was the tournament. It seemed the story and script was overwhelmed by the decades of story from the game. It needs sequels to complete what I watched. It seems they set up for one. It made me feel like this movie was made to set up more. Overall they stayed faithful, and developed a movie lovers of the franchise cannot ignore to love. Gore, funny, action.","positive"
9,"What do you expect? It's fun. Not meant to be Citizen Kane... director and cast did a great job with what this is. An ultra-violent fun b-action movie. Grow up 1 star folks. Go write a scathing review about The Expendables next... or? Get the giant sticks out of your a##'s and realize that sometimes people want to just have fun. This team provided that.So why beat down this crew for doing pretty close to exactly as good a job as they could have done with the source material (an ultra-violent 80's video game)... I had fun. My family had fun. Even my dog had fun.I get it. I was a 12 year old discovering Quentin Tarantino for the first time too once. Critiquing everything, and crying over the beauty of a floating shopping bag... dancing in the wind... but sometimes you just gotta enjoy a guy getting his arms frozen off. Y'know? FINISH HIM!Great job to this team, thanks for distracting us for a weekend from the horror of the modern world.","positive"
10,"I have been fan of Mortal Kombat for a few years, and this movie is perfect for the videogame, if you know the history and characters you will be excited if you watch it, since the cast, story and fights are exactly what I imagined. Mortal Kombat is cheesy in its way, and I love that they captured that, but some people could not understand this. Anyways, I cannot wait for the second part of this movie.(Ps: Sorry if my English is not that good, but I needed to talk about this movie)","positive"
8,"Probably one of so few game-based movies done right out there, it feels really like Mortal Kombat, though not as brutal as the game, the CGI is good, the story is easy to follow, the dual fights could be made longer, and shame the Indonesian film censorship institute for cutting out some of the iconic fatality moments, I mean, they already give it R rating and only allow those who are 17 and over to watch yet they still censor it, what was the rating for then? As much as disappointing their country's heavy censorship is, Indonesian viewers can still take pride of their fellow countryman actor becomes the MVP of the movie. Joe Taslim really nails the Sub-Zero role, and I can say pretty much that almost none of the other characters can be considered as miscast. So yeah, looking forward to MK 2, of course with the high hope that not even a single moment being cut out.","positive"
9,"As a lifelong mortal kombat fan this movie exceeded my expectations and I had high expectations. They incorporated great humor and the signature moves left out in the 1995 cult classic. I pray they pick this up for the proposed 3 or 4 movie series. I like how they left it open and didn't force too many characters like they do in some other video game adaptions. I would have liked 30 min longer with more back story for the other characters included in the movie but I understand a 2 hour and 30 min movie is a lot to ask.Fantastic work around sub zero and the CGI effects.","positive"
9,"How could you dislike this movie?! I love all the keyboard warriors(who probably live in their parents basement, and have never experienced the warmth of a woman)on here dissecting this movie that's based on a video game. This movie isn't going to win any awards, but it served it's purpose. It has great fights and special effects, unexpected comedy(Kano), and all the nostalgia I had from the video games growing up. Certainly after the last MK movies, this was quite a different and welcoming experience. So sit back, relive your days in the arcades, and your parents basement(when it WAS acceptable)and enjoy an entertaining flick.","positive"
5,"Pros:
The Opening Sequence is AMAZING!!!The Fight Choreography is great.Hiroyuki Sanada is the BEST Actor in this movie.Sub-Zero actually feels very threatening.Cons:
THERE'S NO MORTAL KOMBAT IN THIS MORTAL KOMBAT MOVIE!!!!!!WTF is the point of Cole Young? All these amazing original MK characters and the studio says make a new character as the lead. TERRIBLE Decision!!!Lewis Tan is not a good actor especially considering he's the lead! In fact most of the actors either didn't fit their character or weren't trying hard enough.The Dialogue is BAD. Especially when using the lines from the game. Felt so forced!So many wasted characters: Reptile, Goro, Kabal, Kung Lao etc.Liu Kang, Raiden and Jax were all underused.The villains, aside from Sub-Zero, we're very flat and unthreatening.The script is WEAK. They should've scrapped it and started fresh.I was cautiously looking forward to this. I really loved the games as a kid and the trailer looked great! Sadly, the trailer is the best thing about this film. Every decision feels like a misstep. I don't know who decided to not have the MK Tournament but that was such a mistake. The film has no urgency without it and honestly just felt like they were stalling for time the entire film just to set up a sequel. It's like they were checking boxes with each scene with nothing authentic holding it together. You really don't feel anything for the characters outside of Sub-Zero and Scorpion, and Scorpion is only in two scenes. This whole film feels like a missed opportunity. The animated film Scorpion's Revenge is still the best MK adaptation to date. If you enjoyed this film, I'm happy for you but I struggled to keep watching it. 5/10.","negative"
4,"Terrible acting, mediocre film all round, but what's unforgiveable is the well below average fight choreography, especially from. Lewis Tan (who can't act at all).The only saving grace for this movie was. Josh Lawson as Kano, who was genuinely quite funny and actually a very likeable character, but the rest of it was pretty bad, the original movie was better.Very disappointed, this movie will absolutely not stand the test of time...forgettable.","negative"
8,"Good movie for the people who enjoyed their child hood with Mortal Kombat Game.","positive"
7,"You shouldn't be taking this more as the fan service that it is. I never really played the games, but watched the playthroughs and story modes quiet a bit.I always loved the Fatalities and you got them here, even some kind of inside jokes from the game.I would really like another movie.It wasn't a masterpiece, but it was enjoyable to watch.","positive"
7,"Is it perfect? No
Is it fun? Yes
Does it makes sense? Yes
Does it take itself too seriously? No
Could it have been better? Yes
Do I want to see a whole franchise with more movies like this one? Absolutely.","positive"

7,"The movie was fun and entertaining, but without hiroyuki sanada and Joe taslim, this movie is nothing... :-)","positive"
9,"The movie pays so much homage to the video games, it's incredible. From fatalities, to hidden Easter eggs, I loved this movie. Introducing a new character can be tough, but they give you just enough about him to feel invested. I'm excited, and hopeful, that this movie will gain enough traction to give us a sequel as that ending has me itching for one! Great movie for entertainment. The action scenes are stellar and the movie is packed with MK characters. The dialogue is pretty great, too. (I'm looking at you, Kano). I highly recommend this movie for those who love MK and who enjoy a great action movie!","positive"
9,"Things happened fast in this movie but overall it was thoroughly enjoyable!","positive"

9,"As a fan of MK for over 25+ years I must say I was terrified the movie wouldn't be great with hearing of the change In story, characters etc but it exceeded all my expectations! The character adaptions were great, Kano was hilarious, Sub Zero - one word - EPIC! The special effects and fight scenes were amazing! So much more than I imagined. I hope to see many more sequels and prequels delving more into the amazing and expansive universe of MK and it's characters. Great fun and an entertaining film <U+0001F60D>","positive"
10,"I feel that if Kevin Tancharoen (who directed MK Legacy) had done this movie, the praise would be immediate and harmonious. He had a sincere vision when he did MK Legacy, and that was missing here. They clearly took notes from him and tried to make the movie he would make, but they failed. I want a resurgence of MK movies as much as the next nerd, but I think they tried and missed the mark, and Kevin wouldn't have.","positive"
7,"Mortal Kombat, A fantasy movie that besides the interesting characters of Scorpion and Sub-Zero, some nice fights and development, especially in the beginning, everything else can be put aside and nearly ignored. The main protagonist is as interesting as a bunny in armor and Mehcad Brooks has been seen enough in Supergirl!Its (+) are its action and CGI and its (-) are loads of cheesiness, lack of darkness and depth.Of course, for the sake of the flow of the movie and the heroes' reward, the bad guys had to be taken out one by one, even if they were to suddenly do crazy things, to stand still, watching their wounds and blood in disbelief, while the shiny nice opponent delivers the final blows.Any time, the writers & producers are able to deliver a Mortal Kombat as dark and twisted as Saw (2004), I would applaud profusely.Screenplay/story: 7.5Development: 7.5Entertainment: 8Acting: 7.5Filming/cinematography: 8CGI/VFX: 8Music/score: 7.5Depth: 5.5Logic: 6Flow: 7.5Suspense/fantasy: 7Ending: 7.","positive"
1,"I fell in love with Mortal Kombat with Mortal Kombat 2 and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 when I was about ten years old. This would have been somewhere around 1998. I have played through every mainseries game, watched both movies, and watched the cartoon acress these 23 years now. I say all this because I want the reader to understand my love for this franchise so that they can understand why I hate this movie so much.I hate this movie because this movie is not Mortal Kombat. That's the simplest and most direct way I can communicate this to you. If you asked me to show you one thing that you could walk away from and say that you have a core grasp on what Mortal Kombat is; I would say play through the story mode of Mortal Kombat 2011. That game is very respectful to the original story whilst aslo rebooting it at the same time. It retells the story of the first three games and you'll walk away from it knowing what Mortal Kombat is. I would not recommend you watch this movie to understand what Mortal Kombat is. In fact, I'd recommend you run screaming in the opposite direction of this movie.Why Mr. Reviwer, that sound pretty harsh and mean. What do you mean by these statements? The movie was made with love from people who cared about the games and wanted to provide nothing but fan service to you. You dare spit in their face? Why?Well, let me put it this way. This movie is about a character who isn't a Mortal Kombat character, who decends from a character who never existed in the games, who herself decended from a Mortal Kombat character. Sound generic and stupid? You bet it is! But wait, it gets worse! Because of this long line of bloodline decent that never existed in the games (and thus this bloodline link to these nonexistent characters had no importance in the games) main hero not Mortal Kombat character is destined to disover the inner power this nonexistent bloodline link gives him to fullfill a prohpecy that also, you guessed it, doesn't exist in the games. It isn't even a tournament. It's a pre-fight assisination of characters. Which is also horrible, because we have no atmosphere of a tournament and don't even get to see Shang Tsung's Island.So, at this point, you might be asking; does this movie have anything to do with the games at all? And, the answer, of course, is a resounding, complete, and total no. This is nothing more than a generic cash grab that called itself Mortal Kombat, dressed itself with Mortal Kombat characters, and drenched itself in blood. But, a gorry movie does not a Mortal Kombat story make; when you completely ignore the lore of the Mortal Kombat games.This movie, in all respects, should have been essentually a hybrid of Mortal Kombat 1995 with the Mortal Kombat 1 elements of the story as they were done in Mortal Kombat 2011 (sans the message back in time stuff) with a hard R rating. That's it. Plain and simple.Watch Liu Kang, erm, I mean generic martial arts gary stu be shoehorned into the main character role as he embarks on a quest to Shang Tsung's mysterious island, erm, I mean warehouse. To compete in the great tournament of Mortal Kombat, erm, I mean to try to not be picked off by its fighters before they even get to Shang Tsung's island. There, glimpse the otherworldy Outworld, erm, I mean giant cliff where Shang Tsung sits his throne and talks a lot. Be amazed as Prince Goro battles Liu Kang, erm I mean Johhny Cage, whoops, erm, I mean Gary Stu in Goro's Lair, erm, I mean atop a cliff on Shang Tsung's island, whoops, erm, I mean, exiting a rural barn.Not saying that Mortal Kombat 1995 fallowed the story perfectly either. It doesn't. But, at least it tries to do its best with its PG-13 raiting to squeeze as much of Mortal Kombat's ambience, mystery, wonder, and personality of characters into the rating it had to work with. It brought us Shang Tsung's island, had two amazing Goro fights, and an actual tournament atmosphere.This new movie is not a tournament, does not show us Shang Tsung's island reimagined with modern speciel effects technology, does not fallow a Mortal Kombat character as its main character, and in general does not feel like Mortal Kombat.It felt like a low budget knock off that couldn't afford to build the sets or visit an actual island for filming. So, instead, cooked up this lazy story to try to explain why none of the cool things that happened in the games and the 1995 movie never actually materialize on screen in this movie.It's Mortal Tease. It's Mortal let's ditch Liu Kang and fallow a Gary Stu when pulled out of our butt to be the long lost whatever to Scorpion becase he decended from his non-existent daughter. Yes, Scorpion gets a daughter now. Not sure where she came from. Was never in the games at all. But, he has a daughter now.You know, Gary would have made a much better character as a sort of decedent to Scorpion of he was just Takashi Takeda from Mortal Kombat X. It would have made so much sore sense with the lore and he kind of looks like him.Of all the amazing atmosphere posibilities from the setting of the original game, of all the characters that exist in the Mortal Kombat franchise; this movie has so little respect for that franchise that it instead gives us a Gary Stu, with a contrived past for the sole purpose of connecting him to a character that is actually from the game and matters, and completely sidelines Liu Kang to give us non-interesting Gary Stu's origin story.Because when I think Mortal Kombat, I certainly think of a no-name nobody fighting Goro in what might as well be his back yard; who sucks so bad at fighting he needs saved with an axe. Yeah... totally what I got when I played these games. Who could possible have wanted anything different than this? Goro in his lair or somewhere else cool on Shang Tsung's island? Nah man, Goro in the back yard coming out of a barn.Nitara? The character most fans dismissed so hard that we haven't seen her in a game sense 2007's Mortal Kombat Armageddon on the Wii? That's totally a character out of many fan favorites that needed to be brought back.I could go on, and on, and on, and on. But, the point is this. This game was not made by fans for fans. This game was made for general audiences who know Mortal Kombat is that thing where martial artists fight ninjas and monsters and it's bloody and gory. Or, in short, they had no faith in the lore of Mortal Kombat at all and instead created a generic martial arts gore film because they knew casual audiences don't know the difference between that and Mortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat has a multiple decades long complex lore that rivals many film and movie franchises in its complexity. Amazing characters and world building. But, sadly, none of that is on display in this movie. Instead, we get whoever guy fighting randomly inserted Mortal Kombat character for lack of reason in uninteresting and not game locations.I enjoyed the 1995. I was so happy to learn that all these years later we'd be getting something like that again, but R rated this time. What I got was a slap in the face. As a Mortal Kombat fan, this offends me. This is not fan service. This is general audience pandering. If you don't know the difference, you shouldn't have made this movie.This movie is scoring well, with its intended audience. Too bad that audience isn't Mortal Kombat fans.","negative"
9,"This movie shows the potential for what it can do, this movie needs to be successful which is looking good for it to have better put together sequels. Personally none of my favorite characters were in the movie but I think overall they did a great Job making the mortal kombat players come to life. I am looking forward to seeing what they can do in the future; as of now this movie feeds the kid in me. If I was not a fan of mortal kombat I could see me giving this movie a 7/10 instead of a 9, but I am happy.","positive"
10,"Man this movie brought back some good 90s memories!! I love it!!! I really hope they will continue the story.","positive"
1,"Cole Young? No Thank you. 1995 Mortal Kombat was better. Heck, even Mortal Kombat Annihilation was better. This movie is laughably awful.","negative"
5,"There's no tournament in a movie called ""Mortal Kombat""? Shang Tsung and gang tries to assassinate Earthrealms champions, but that's not the classic plot you may expected from a MK movie. And it takes about an hour something happens in this film. That hour before there's only exposition, characters walk in some unspectacular desert locations and boring training sequences you want to skip next time.Kano wins! Josh Lawson seems like the only actor, who had really fun and can get more out of his role. Hiroyuki Sanada is a great Scorpion, but they gave him absolutely none screentime. The Action and the effects were quite awesome, as well as the cosplay. Joe Taslim did a great job as Sub-Zero. The beginning and his fight with Scorpion were the best parts. If you can mix the gory action of this reboot with the enjoyable characters from the Original, it would be a really good MK movie. Overall it was watchable and partly entertaining enough to give it an average rating. The animated movie last year is still the best MK movie out there yet.","negative"
1,"After 25-odd years spent imaging what the MK universe could look like utilising current technology, I was thrilled to hear that this film was being made. However, within 15 minutes of watching this movie I realised that I was about to endure a level of Hell that not even Scorpion himself would be capable of enduring.The story itself is very clunky and the writers use some extremely rudimentary dialogue to try and bridge the gap for the audience. Compounding this issue are the wooden acting performances by a number of main characters in the film which make the excremental stench of the dialogue seem even more prominent.The prospect of seeing current day VFX paint the visuals of the MK world was a major point of excitement going into this movie, but any dreams that I had of seeing worlds with detail and grandeur of Azguard were slowly ripped away. From ice formations that looked like plastic through to a janky reptilian creature, it appears as though there was either not enough budget or a complete miscalculation from a style point of view. The MK world is supposed to be gritty and dark!Although there were moments where a darker setting managed to reduce the sting of the subpar graphics, much of the film is played out against backdrops that feel out of place for an MK movie and felt highly cartoonish. A certain 'Thunder God' who appears in this film looked downright ridiculous when viewed up close, sporting a pair of 'electric eyes' that were on par with the VFX seen in the Incredible Hulk series from
The 1970s.The performance of Josh Lawson as Kano was definitely the highlight of the movie, and would have fit perfectly as a point of levity if this film was executed in a more appropriately dark and brooding tone. The fight scenes involving Scorpion and Subzero were also a shinning light in this film, with both actors doing a fantastic job despite the script.Overall, the amount that is wrong with this film would not allow me to revel in the nostalgia of seeing some of my favourite characters on screen. There were points in this movie that were so cringeworthy that I may have uppercutted myself into a pit of spikes of given the chance, and upon reflection, the name 'Shang Stung' may have been an appropriate title for this movie, because It took a piece of my soul and left me feeling dead inside.","negative"
4,"I must I admit I did enjoy the beginning of the movie and the set up. The begining with Bi-Han and Hanzo was done great, but the more the movie goes on, the worse it becomes, culminating around minute 70 where the screenwriter didn't know what to do and just started teleporting characters around (even worse offense compared to X-Men: Apocalypse)The movie has Act 1 which is passable, entertaining at best thanks to the comic relief of Kano's character, ACT 2 DOES NOT EXIST and act 3 is utter garbage.Dear I see that this is the first movie for screenwriter Greg Russo.Greg if you are reading this, please take a few more screenwriting lessons, this was lazy at best. Even by Mortal Kombat plot standers which can be laugably bad but charming (I played 7 games and watched the 90s movies) this was reeaaaly bad in plot department.","negative"
5,"While this was okay to decent, I preferred MK legacy and even the original cheesy 1995 film to this one. The opening scene was really good and it got my hopes up, but after that, aside from the comic relief of Kano, the whole thing just fell a little flat.The story was all over the place and often rushed. They really didn't do justice to many of the characters and the decision to add a new character did not sit well with me. The treatment of Goro in this movie was criminal and the actor who portrayed Shang Tsung was a terrible casting choice.The CGI was good, and I felt they handled the gore really well (not too little, not too much), but I found the fights as a whole to be quite lackluster.Having Sub-Zero as main villain was cool (pun intended). But needed more Scorpion and less Cole (or better yet, no Cole).Overall, enjoyable enough to pass the time, but don't get your hopes up too high or you will be disappointed.","negative"
7,"It's an OK movie with some nice action. I thought it was going to be a great movie the first 15 minutes in, but it did go down hill from there.The story line was corny, the acting was corny, and they missed a lot of opportunities to bring more of the MK universe into the movie. The movie was too short and seemed rushed and disjointed.However, the action was fun, the CGI was well done, and I was entertained.","positive"
9,"MORTAL KOMBAT!!!!! I was 15 when the original one came out in 1995 loved and couldnt wait for the story to continue.....was 17 when the sequel came in 1997 and was bummed out BIG TIME, I thought the franchise in the movie business was dead and buried, then came glimmers of hope with limited series and animated movie over the last few years. NOW we have a new movie for 2021 and I have to say I ENJOYED EVERY BIT OF GORE AND FAN SERVICE IT GAVE. Bring on The Tournament.","positive"
9,"Okay so as I start a lot of reviews (for better or for worse) if you are walking into this expecting Shakespeare or anything resembling a critique of the human condition you are deluding yourself. If you are walking in expecting a balls to the wall adaptation of a video game primarily about a fighting tournament with all the promised gore and even some clever nods to fight conclusions from the game you, my friend are in luck because this movie is great fun and really does it's best o bring the world of the games to life.There are no surprises in the pacing, you are basically introduced to the main players as basically as possible, but this is fine because it's all just set up to incredible fight sequences and a decent little revenge plot
This earns it's R18+ rating(here in Australia it's akin to the NC-17 In the U. S.) to the film maker's credit the fatalities are graphic and unlike other films the bloodshed is gruesome and graphic
Here's hoping that the box office is set alight for this and this will pave the way for big budget game adaptations by high profile quality film makers... I'm looking at you BioShock
All in all this is a funviole t and beautifully shot film.","positive"

7,"First things first - I'm super pissed they didn't yell MOORRTTAALLLL KOOMMMBBAAATTT"" even once during the movie. I waited to hear it and was so disappointed *insert thug tear here*Moving on, I thought the movie was solid!! Seeing some of my faves (like Scorpion, Raiden and Sub-Zero) took me back to my youth when I spent hours playing Mortal Kombat, trying to hit fatalities on the wretched Sega controller. It's gory and now that I'm a bit older it can be hard to watch but I knew what to expect going in. All in all MK had great fight scenes, so-so character development and tons of nostalgia. You can't go into these movies thinking they will be Oscar worthy or you'll be disappointed.As they said in Gladiator - I was, in fact, quite entertained and am looking forward to the next one!","positive"
5,"Having waited 20 years for a new MK movie to come out, I felt that I was let down by this movie.It was extremely fast paced, there were many holes in the plot, and the MK characters which I've grown up with did not get the adequate screen time they deserved. Which bugged me the most because it had all the potential to earn its ""flawless victory"" tagline, but it fell short.With the 1995 MK movie, you kinda fall in love with the main characters because they had personality and they were given time to shine on screen. With this movie however, I personally could not connect or feel anything towards most of the MK characters. In other words, the acting wasn't that great.Putting all of this aside, the movie was still enjoyable and fun. It pays homage to the video game in a good way with the gory fatalities and bloody fighting scenes. But that's about it!","negative"
1,"Perfect example of bad movie ,over acting ,nonsense dialogue presentation , stupid laughable dresses and extremely boring.Media is always paid when an expensive movie is directed to show it as awesome movie , and same is here . Not a single scene looks original , background music dont even match scene ,actors are d-.Dont waste money just in case u are going to see it on bbo max and planning to pay hbo just for it .","negative"
6,"I was really hyped for this movie and because of the casting I had some expectations, but I was really let down at the end.The script is just plain bad. Cole Young is a boring and forgettable character and my initial feeling proved me right that he was a very bad idea to focus the movie around. Kano was by far the best thing about this movie. Even though I was no fan at all of this Arcana nonsense and how they got their powers. Completely unnecessary.Mortal Kombat has almost 30 years of lore, there was no need for this.Goro, Mileena and Kung Lao were totally wasted. Shang Tsung taking Kungs soul out of nowhere felt really off and had no pay off - at least for me.Reiko could've been literally any other character - completely interchangeable.Raiden was just kinda there.I'm really mad what they did to Reptile. He didn't look good and had no need to be there. Same for Goro, they said he was so expensive and then they waste him for Cole???I guess you could say the final fight had some memorable moments between Scorpion and Sub-Zero, but then Cole dragged it down for me.Guess I'm too spoiled with the Raid and IP Man movies too expect an epic fight in an American movie.The few fatalities were fun.This is just a set up for the next movie because we never make it to the tournament. Guess Shang Tsung can bring everyone back, but Cole remains a big problem.I just hope the producers take the criticism to heart and really deliver with the next one, but it's WB and they don't really get the fans. Unfortunately there is no Snyder Cut of this movie.","negative"
1,"Cringe and no development, it felt like I was watching a sitcom about mock superheroes. No respect to the game.","negative"
6,"This film, while being well shot and produced, is a disaster in the story department and writing.These collection of scenes only exist to showcase the characters abilities and rivalries and nothing else.Sure, it's action packed, but if all you are getting are for-show character fight scenes that are just put in for the fans, you're better off just playing the game.","negative"
1,"* There is no end credit scene *Simon McQuoid, in his feature directorial debut and crew, brought an unwatchable adaptation. I don't know which part was worse the direction, the story, the music, or the performances. I wasn't surprised at how terrible the film was because, from the moment the trailer hit, I instantly knew how bad it might be. Such a shame because when they announced for the first time that a Mortal Kombat movie was in the works I was so thrilled especially since it was rated R. I was more excited by it because I thought the fatalities were going to be gruesome and entertaining to watch. I can't believe I'm going to say this but I prefer to watch the Mortal Kombat 1995 version over this reboot. There wasn't a scene that I enjoyed everything was going from bad to worse and all I kept thinking about was to end the film but I kept holding on and on watching how the seconds were so slow for it to finish. I only felt happiness the moment it hit the end credits, I almost yelled ""finally!"". This movie felt like I was watching a low-budget bad TV Show that took too long to end for it to finish. When the moment came on the film to explain Mortal Kombat it was like a blur with no suspense behind it. Everything was crashing down, scene after scene making too much humor with unimpressive fight sequences trying to hide the bad script and failing at it. I didn't mind that there was no actual tournament their idea to move past that was good but only the idea because the way everything unfolded was excruciating to watch.The composer Benjamin Wallfisch made the film even worse with his music. Not only I was annoyed by everything but the music was not helping. His music felt extremely out of place and it really didn't go well in any scene. It was making too much out of scenes that needed something smoother and when the scenes got heated the music push too much.The cast performances were painful to watch, not even the incredible Hiroyuki Sanada opening scene could save the film. He is an amazing actor but his part was bad as well and mainly towards the bad script, not his acting skills. The other cast members felt like all of them were rookies, so many of their lines made the scenes so cheesy and not to be taken seriously.","negative"
5,"I will start with the positive. The opening and closing scenes of this film are excellent!Focusing on Scorpion and Sub-zero's story was a solid high point that showcased the best this film had to offer as far as acting performances, fight choreography and interesting plot premise.Unfortunately, the 90+ minutes that occur between these 2 scenes are dull in comparison!Immediately after the exhilarating opening scene, we get introduced to brand new character; Cole Young.As a character, Cole is just blah! Boring. Un-interesting. A down-and-out underdog with no real purpose other than functioning as a major buzz-kill everytime he's on screen.Basically - Cole sucks!!!If the writers wanted to add a new character - at least make him interesting so the audience gives a s*!t about him!I would love to say that Cole is the worst thing about this film but unfortunately the ""bad"" doesn't end with him.Other MK faves are pointlessly inserted throughout the film just so the audience can say ""hey, it's Kabal - there he is"" or ""ooh, no! Here comes Goro"" but serve no real purpose outside of this!Rayden and Shang Tsung literally could have been played by anyone!They had NO personality whatsoever!Rayden could barely speak english and delivered his dialogue like it was a dress rehearsal for an amature theatre production.Shang Tsung was a generic TV villain straight out of Power Rangers!No black contact lenses could make up for the lack of ""menace"" about him.This film desperately needed Cary Tagawa back in the role of Shang Tsung - his charisma and menacing grimace was a stand-out of the 1995 original film.Heck - his performance was so good that they bought him back for MK11!Why not this film?!Outside of Sub-zero and Scorpion - the only likeable character in this film is Kano!He gets the best dialogue of all characters (I suspect much of it is improvised), had he not been in the film - that 90 minutes between the intro and ending would have been an absolute snore-fest!I realise I'm sounding overly harsh here but the thing is - Im a long time MK fan.I grew up with the original game trilogy, read the comics and watched the film's.I'm an MK fan for life and this film was an insult to MK fans everywhere!People say we need to turn our brain's off to enjoy these types of film's - but there's a difference between turning off your brain and having to get a labotomy to enjoy a movie!Very dissapointing.I hope that a sequel brings in a new team of (creative) writers, a more competent Director and that they kill off Cole within Act 1 as it would be a huge disservice having a non-canon plank of wood win the tournament!","negative"
1,"This has a few redeeming moments, but the original is better.","negative"
1,"Imagine a Lord of the Rings movie without the One ring or Harry Potter movie without magic. They literally made a Mortal Kombat movie without mortal kombat and who the hell is Cole Young? Newbie kills one of the thoughest fighter in sec. Liu Kang and Raiden writing was so lame. They didn't do anything to the story. There is no point making Cole and Hanzo relative. Story and dialogues were cheesy.","negative"
1,"After finishing the entire movie. I felt disappointed and annoyed. This movie is very inaccurate of the mortal kombat story. The lines were beyond corny. In one line Kano had mentioned ""Magic Mike"" during his kombat with Lui Kang, that's embarrassing. The movie was soo unfinished. The movie is just a fat No for me. I don't even want a 2nd part because the 1st part wasn't even done.","negative"
1,"With exception of Sanada and Lawson, everyone's acting is terrible!VFX looks like low budget indie sci-fi, music/sfx is disruptinveand worse of all: Script is astonishingly cluttered and lacks of meaningful dialogue or coherent story!!Shame!","negative"
9,"This is much better version of mortal kombat... though the storyline can be better... but this movie is enjoyable...","positive"
8,"So 8 stars because of how much I enjoyed this movie though I should note that I'm a Mortal Kombat fan so I'm a little biased in that sense. However, the choreography was excellent, the fighting and fatalities were great, there was cheese but not too much (have to expect some from Mortal Kombat though), the actors (especially Kano) were all great.There are definite flaws though. The CGI was mediocre, presumably due to budget constraints, but hopefully with the success of this movie we'll get a slightly larger budget for the next one that will hopefully lead to some better CGI.The other main flaw was the script. Now I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowing and yet, they teased me with that opening scene. Handled fantastically in every possible way, script including, I was then hoping the rest of the movie would keep up that pace but it kind of hit a bump with the introduction of Cole & all the other characters and setting up the MK world. It was that weird kind of thing where certain aspects seemed rushed (not enough backstory about anyone to care too much about their fate) yet other aspects made it all feel a little dragged out (trying to unlock their powers).There's too many details to go into here about it but the simple way to word my conclusion would be that this would actually work very, very well as a series. Most of the problems with this film and script and pacing/editing and I feel like a lot of that could be solved if it was episodic instead of trying to cram it all into an average-length movie. They could still do some films, like about certain characters or rivalries, but the main chunk of the universe and even the tournament itself, should all be part of a series in my opinion.","positive"
1,"Lazy and laughable writing, boring dialogues, fatalities for fatalities' sake. Forgettable soundtrack. Main protagonist is just dull and has plot armor. Literally.Kung Lao and Sub-Zero (and their respective actors) are perfect. Kano could have been perfect too, if not for that Arkana thing... What is that, by the way..?Watched this movie two weeks ago. Left theater, before the movie ended. So disappointed, that it still hurts.","negative"
1,"You are not making a good movie when you put some sitcom jokes into serious, tense moments. You gotta focus on senario and screenplay. Well, which this movie does not have unfortunately.","negative"
3,"If you are a fan of Mortal Kombat and you grew up with the franchise, just don't go see it, or go see it with a friend. It's just not worth it and it is a real slap to the face to the fans. Cole is a weak character, and there's just so many bad decisions in this movie. After a couple hours seeing it, I am still very angry and that is why I am giving three stars, if it was just bad I would have had given maybe 5 stars.","negative"
1,"For any true fan of Mortal Kombat, avoid this all together and forget it ever existed.","negative"
1,"The movie's very dull, bad acting, bad story line, introduction of an unwanted character.Opening scene wasn't very strong either, it's just mediocre at best. I'd call Man of Steel, Batman vs. Superman, Dark Knight openings as amazing opening, not this garbage.The characters look like they're 19 or something, what's up with that?Keno was the best thing in this movie.A new character destroying Goro in their first encounter?Honestly, it's missed opportunity, really disappointed.","negative"
4,"Who green lit this to be made this way? I guess New Line figured if it could contain blood and gore it would succeed, but even that is lackluster here.There is 25 to 30 years worth of Mortal Kombat games and backstories to choose from and yet they introduce a brand new character named Cole who adds nothing to the film other than figuring out he can grow a poor man's version of Aquamans top.The plot is weak. Shang T-Sung is killing off those who will fight in the Mortal Kombat tournament for Earth.... and we get no tournament??? Really?The introduction to these characters is bad, and the villains are introduced so badly they belong in Mortal Kombat: Anhilation. Yes. Its that Bad! Shang T-Sung literally says each of his henchman names so the audience knows who they are... all located on a terrible bridge of some sort.The movie becomes a train wreck with just about every decision it makes. It had potential to go places, but it just gets swept of its feet and fatalitied.It's plan is to make a sequel. Why bother? Who cares where these characters are going and who will be in the next one? It's not worth continuing.","negative"
8,"This was the best movie I have watched recently.I love action and fighting movies, scenes were clean and clear. In some movies they show the fight from very stupid angles and we can't even understand if they are fighting or dancing. This movie was very satisfying in fighting scenes. Good quality.","positive"

9,"I liked the movie overall but there were some shortcomings. The main shortcoming was plot of the movie. I didn't really like the plot.There were amazing scenes, amazing combats among characters. Sub Zero and Scorpion so cool. Their designs are so amazing. Some fatalities are like in the game.I didn't like Cole young as a character but Lewis Tan is martial artist and he did good job. So for me 9/10.","positive"
9,"I liked the changes they made to the traditional MK story! The fighting was amazing, I'm glad they didn't spoil it in the trailers.If you're a fan of MK you'll enjoy the movie for sure. Kano is the best part of it. I wish they had more of a budget to handle outworld better but I'm sure they'll fix that in the sequel.","positive"
1,"Okay, so I thought the 90s version was bad... until I saw this train wreck of a movie! The casting was absolutely terrible because they didn't fit their characters.The main actor who played Cole is very stale and too boring to be the main character. And don't even get me started on Liu Kang. He looks so weak compared to the 90s actor!The only interesting thing was Kano & Sub Zero. Kano's lines felt more natural than the rest of the actors. And Sub Zero was actually pretty dope. I just hated how his costume wasn't blue. It's his signature!","negative"
10,"This movie is everything the fans of the video game franchise could have wanted. The cast were all so spot on in their portrayals of each character, they were exactly how they are in the games.You do really need to know a basic background about this movie before watching it, as it doesn't leave you any time to figure things out! I would advise non-fans of the video game to do a wee search beforehand on the basic story.It's still an amazing action movie if you're not interested in the backstory, just turn off your brain a bit & don't expect your question answered too well.The guys behind the movie have made it for the fans, so that is why you're expected to know a certain amount of the lore.Only thing close to a ""bad thing"" I can say that is wrong with this is that it could have been longer! But to be fair, if it had been 4 hours I would probably have still wanted it longer! I understand they are setting up a good few sequels (sooooo happy about that) so they didn't want all their eggs in one basket, so to speak. They will be spreading all the different stories out over a few movies I reckon & I cannot wait for it.As a fan, this was everything I had wanted in a movie adaptation. The gore, the ACTORS, the fight scenes, the story - it was all perfect. I cannot wait to see how this franchise expands in the coming years.10/10 best fight sequence type film I have seen since the Matrix. You can really tell the people who made the movie are actual true fans of the Mortal Kombat universe & it makes a massive difference.","positive"
6,"I enjoyed the first part of the movie, however the pacing and acting ability of the some of the actors did not impress me. Guy who played Kano did a great job!","negative"
1,"One of the worst movies I have watched based on a video game bad writting bad directing only the actors tried but couldn't save it lol.","negative"
1,"I kept thinking to myself how amateurish this was, and so I looked up the director. This is his first feature film, with no other credits to his name.But it's not entirely on him that this is an uninteresting flop. The writing is bad, and the characters are completely unconvincing.Seeing everyone dressed up in their outfits reminded me of The Guyver or more likely, the bad guys from the Power Rangers.This movies is unwatchable and should have never been made.","negative"
1,"Sorry to say but the fight scene its so horrible choreographed and horrible edits. Too much cut and the movement of fight was slow. For example, Sonya vs Milenna. I thought this movie will look like The Raid movie cause Joe Taslim was in it. But after I watched this movie, Im really disappointed. The physics are incorrect in this movie. Like look at Milenna jump. Look like it on strings. Sonya walking on the wall also look like it on strings like Mulan movie.","negative"
4,"I don't want to criticize someone's work but the loyal to the game bits and trademark shout outs aren't enough to excuse the non existent character development and undeniably problematical fast moving plot that doesn't stop long enough even once for you to care about anyone or anything that is happening at any time...The non-stop over the top comedic relief of Kano which immediately signaled to me the movie wasn't to be taken seriously, I soon realized was going to be the ""best"" part of poor film. That combined with the brutality, and the attempt to connect you to the protagonists, this film has no idea what it wants to be and unfortunately succeeds at being nothing.The first and last fight sequences are the only two you can tell any effort was made and they themselves end up passable but are swallowed in the shadow of forgettable and even cringe-worthy plot execution. I can't tell if the acting was just terrible b-rate or the unforgivable pacing just made it seem as so.I'm a fan of the games and, for nostalgia reasons the original movie. The latter I know wasn't necessarily a good film but honestly it was paced, choreographed, plotted, and executed better than this film... and embarrassingly overall may have even had better special effects. Even the CGI was poorly done in this new film.The highish rating of this film is undoubtedly the product of a long wait for many fans and in a few months probably around 80% of people will come back to this and amend their opinions because this IS NOT a good movie. No amount of hopes, dreams, ignorance or optimism can protect it from that. I just finished the film an hour ago and already i forget half of it, and that's barely an exaggeration...","negative"
8,"Was it the greatest movie? No. Did it surpass the original? No. Did it surpass Annihilation? Absolutely 10000%. That being said it stayed relatively similar to the lore stuck out as not just another movie with overly excessive gore. It was fun and easily one or two rungs below the first one. Would love to see sequels.","positive"
1,"I have very mixed feelings after watching this. It had some really cool costumes and some fights were cool, but most fights felt really meh tbh. In my opinion 1995 movie had actually better fights and i'm not even die hard 1995 version fan. Also leaving Johnny Cage out of the movie because he is white makes no sense. Specially if reasoning is that they were going for more Asian feel. But that doesn't make any sense. Kano is white, Sonya is white, Jax is black. How do they fit more into Asian theme? If anything, it would have been easier to leave out Sonya, because Sonya has never been as popular as Johnny Cage. Sonya has always been boringly serious character, with no interesting personality.","negative"

I am asking ? Some youtuber made this movie ?Previous movie was better... surely new graphics are good but i like former cast more especially lord raiden ....","negative"
10,"I was a teen when MK came out, played nearly every game and seen the original movies. I don't understand how people can honestly give a subpar review. This is 100x better than the original movies. People can be too critical for their own good. I can watch this over and over and I hope they make the sequel dispute these uppity reviewers and critics.","positive"
1,"People seem made up of tomato sauce, the story is weak and effects are bad. It feels like a bad movie from the 90's.","negative"
6,"Some points, on what I would have done differently, and hopefully the suquel addresses. (spoilers incoming)1. No need to rationalize everything for the audience. The audience knows the deal already. Certainly no need for a new character (the audience's representative) who isn't miles cooler than tons of existing characters. Instead, add a pinch of humor to the thing. 1995 movie was far from perfect, but it gave us iconic moments like Raiden's ""I don't think so"" or anything with Shang Tsung. Whereas 2021's Raiden and Shang Tsung came off as ''replacements''. That said Kano's writing was good, much funnier than other action films' comic relief characters usually are.2. The editing in the fights must be very light and long. The one core value of a movie like this is choreography, it must be front and center. Bourne type editing takes away the USP.3. Do away with that mediocre forgettable orchestral score! Infuse the fights with some drive, give it some tasteful techno. In some other cases, ethereal ambient (oriental) would have totally worked too. Like during the ancient warriors' clash.4. Scenery lacks in the film. I hope it was a budget constraint which will be eliminated for the sequel.Bonus: 1995's ninja reptile was incomparably cooler than the big lizard here. That was the best fight in the older film in fact.Bonus 2: Goro deserved better.","negative"

It felt Rush.","negative"

1,"I'm glad I grew up with the games and the MK 1995 & 1997 Movies. I was waiting for so long and this movie is a total dissapointment for such a fan like me. Instead of enjoying while watching it made me feel angry. No music, no excitement, no vibe... It is a Kombo of MK Scorpion's Revenge (2020), MK Annihilation (1997)'s Dragon marks and MK 1995's ideas all used but gone wrong. Movie that could be liked only by Kids but not by HardKore Fans who know the KlassiKs!","negative"
10,"This was great, being a massive fan of the games I knew this was going to be good. They got details right, the perfect amount of blood, the story was intriguing, I dont understand all the negative reviews as I thought this was amazing from start to finish. This film is the type you gotta see if you're a die hard fan of the games, I didnt think I'd enjoy it as much as I did, im very glad I checked it out.Such an experience its a shame the cinemas wasn't open, highly recommend this to fans and non fans.","positive"
7,"Don't expect a good movie. Just to spend time you can watch.","positive"
5,"I appreciated some aspects of the film. Sub-Zero and Raiden I thought were great. Still like the previous ones better. Otherwise I felt alot of the characters were bland. Too much attetion to some characters like Kano who I felt talked too much took too much time and again original character was better. Some scenes just overdrawn or not necessary. It makes me want to view the original again. Why was Raiden so different? Some characters like Johnny Cage missing and others added like other reviewers stated like maim character not good. I agree should of been centered around johny cage or liu kang. It is still watchable. It was one of the better 2020-2021 movies so far as they have been very few anf far in between.","negative"
3,"This movie was more concerned with setting up a franchise than telling an entertaining story. The violence was great when it was there, but for long stretches I was bored. BORED! In a Mortal Kombat movie! How do you mess up a movie about a martial arts tournament with supernatural powers. They didn't even have a tournament! LONG stretches of people talking about finding their powers. BORING. And I'm down for a high brow serious reboot if it works. This did not work, they didn't even try to make it work. It was obviously written as a pg13 teen movie, and made the decision to make it R afterwards. Rather than making the plot mode adult they added blood. It's awful.Seriously, rent the original. This is a waste. A waste of money, time and an opportunity to reboot this franchise.","negative"
3,"The plot is a chronological order of the various events sent by an author (in the movies this is reflected in the script). It's the plot that makes this movie such a disaster. The film does not know how to unfold neither in the sub zero vs Scorpion rivality nor in the one carried out in the tournament.Every film must start from a script and this must tell the story sequentially and logically. When making a film of this type (video game of platforms fighting), emphasis must be placed on the actors, in this case the characters that intervene in the work and the reason for their existence. Higher than the recent one) the screenwriter took good care of the introduction of the characters and their performance in the film. For many sub zero is the most popular of MK, although it does not necessarily mean that it is the star. Not even Scorpions himself is. So the writers and the direction have to make the participation of the characters in the film minimally dignified and representative, whether these villains or not. Ex Reptile vs. Liu kan in MK part 1 (1995) that combat was epic, although Liu Kan was the winner, those who used to use Repitel in the arcades, I'm sure they were satisfied. Did you see the pathetic reptile in this new version? Makes you want to vomit. And that's just one example, I could give you more but I think the point is clear, right? The early versions of MK movie are better than the recent.","negative"
2,"I gave it 2 stars for Joe Taslim and Hiroyuki Sanada. They are the only thing decent about this movie. Now to go into depth.SPOILER WARNING:I am not going to hold back since I have been a die hard Mortal Kombat fan since I played Mortal Kombat in arcade as a kid. I have played every single game since. The movie does Subzero justice with Bi-Han because he is a ruthless killer and it shows. The production team thought they were justified in creating another character with Cole played by a still piece of wood that is another cliche ""Chosen one"" who honestly made me pray that he would get murdered every time I saw him fight but unfortunately never happened. They also included some of the most ridiculous characters in Mortal Kombat such as Reiko and Nitara who are honestly so annoying that when they were on the receiving ends of a fatality, I laughed. Now we go onto the awful acting of Shang Tsung which I honestly felt like the actor playing him was so boring that I thought he was reading off a teleprompter. But let me get onto the dumbest aspect and it's the story. They play off Cole as this chosen one who was a descendant of scorpion and even the two main heroes in the Mortal Kombat games Liu Kang and Raiden, takes a backseat to this Hollywood garbage can known only as Cole. This whole story of ""Arcana"" nonsense is just so stupid and it completely ruins the integrity of the Mortal Kombat games. But the fatalities are fun though so if you like blood and fighting, then yeah just fast forward through any dialog and just watch the fights.","negative"

4,"The movie was well worth an HBOMax watch. It would not have been, to me, worth a ticket price for each of the family.The action was rigid on all but scenes involving Subzero (oddly) as well as the acting B movie level. I think Kano stole the show, per unique, fullness, and captivating in the performance. Seriously were it not for Kano this would be a 3 as far as I can see it.","negative"

1,"Corny, terrible writing. Original mortal kombat movie has always been in my top 5. The new one tried to fit short back stories into one movie in the cornies, cliche script. Alongside subpar acting. Have been looking forward to a remake of this movie for so long. Couldn't be any more disappointed.","negative"

And why the f..... do you guys always have to rewrite stuff that worked before, we didn't need Cole, we didn't need the rewrite of the characters origin story's, the 90s movie worked better in this regard. The sets and CGI looked also were so incredibly bad, that YouTube series actually looked better then this, You really couldn't afford other locations then a papier-mâché cave and some landfills?!Im a giant fan of the games and just can say, if you want to experience cool mortal kombat story's, play Mortal Kombat IX, X and 11.

4,"A fairly shallow movie that doesn't require any deep thinking. The action is there, and the nods to MK fanfare are abundant. But it really is not a great movie that won't win any awards. The acting is fairly mediocre apart from Kano who is the best part of the movie. I think MK could have been a lot better had their been more character development.I'd have loved to see why Subzero hates the Hasashi bloodline so much and why he wants to destroy it even after centuries. Why?Why did Scorpion descend into hell? What did he learn there? How did he know to emerge from hell at just that precise moment? No buildup and just happened very suddenly with no explanation.How did the tournaments begin and what is the deal with these other realms fighting in it? It doesn't seem to have any rules because Shang Tsung can just flout the rules and engage earthrealm before it officially begins.Who is Kabal, Millenna, Gora, etc? I get it we know their names... but who are they and how did they end up in Outworld?Who are the elder gods? We know Raiden is one of them (I think...) who controls time and space. If Raiden is so powerful why doesn't he just obliterate Outworld? Why was he so restrained in Mortal Kombat?Anyways I could go on... the action is passable and a very good part of the film.I wish it was deeper but good action.","negative"

The Action was awesome! But the Plot/Storyline was <U+0001F44E>. Felt like I was watching Justice League! Horrible!Nothing made sense everything was everywhere!Goro died so easily like wth!They give us a random Bi Han and Hanzo clan drama without even explaining anything!No to be mean but I hardly understood what Raiden said!Liu Kang was booboo, Sonya attractive but booboo, Jax was ight, Cole wth are you!,
Kung Lao was the only perfect thing to come out this movie! His death was random like REALLY!After all the awesomeness he showed us Shang tsung killed him with ease! Like bruh! I'm so disappointed!I'm not satisfied!I choose the 1995 Mortal Kombat and Actors any day!","negative"
1,"Garbage movie! Acting, directing, cinematography, editing, costumes, dialogue, pacing were so awful. Can't believe people are actually giving it good reviews.","negative"
1,"Seriously, I was expecting too much. I felt like all the characters were nerfed. When Kung Lao died all of them just stared like in a 3rd rate Bollywood movie. Fighting choreography was lacking. Camera positioning and use of slow mo could have been hugely improved. They tried to cash in on blood and gore, but without good fight scenes it felt redundant. Any of the 3 video game cut scene collection would have far more worth of time. Hate to say it, even the MK movie from the 90s was better than this disappointment.All this without even considering the fact that they had butchered the classic trilogy plot. Raiden spoke English like a native while Shang Tsun spoke English pretty fluently which I decided to selectively ignore for the love of franchise.In a sentence, an iconic franchise gone horribly wrong by trying cash in some quick buck riding on the fame.I won't surprise if they even fail to rake in the investment. Oh wait, did they even put in any investment in the first place.Anyway, definitely not worth niether the movie ticket money nor the time.","negative"

4,"The long-awaited MK 2021, with a budget of $ 55 million, stages rather an apocalyptic scenario without essence, taste, people. The film essentially has a gear of actors taken as if directly from the benches of the acting school and thrown into the arena of the MK circus, with the exception of Hiroyuki Sanada. This film gives you ""fatality"" due to the lack of crowds, and everything happens predictably at all times, between the same interlocutors, like a chess game with 2 characters (good and bad) and a few pawns, on the board. Visual effects, the only pluses, but too little for 2021. The 1995 film is Rolls Royce next to it.","negative"

""What did you expect? An Oscar winner?""
""It's just a video game movie!""Look, if you found some enjoyment in this movie fine, I have plenty of crappy guilty pleasure movies too (and I really enjoyed the recent Godzilla vs Kong so I'm definitely not above a good mindless slugfest), but let's not pretend this was anything other than bad. It has the very strong stench of being a fan film, but with a slightly higher budget. It really just looks and feels like an enthusiastic amateur effort by cosplayers with some very inconsistent effects thrown on in post.The few halfway decent fight scenes in here weren't worth sitting through the majority of the movie which was just a lot of bad acting, juvenile attempts at being ultra grim dark and edgy yet at the same time shoving cringey out of place game quotes and unfunny comic relief Kano in there, and unreal engine looking particle effects.","negative"
4,"Make no sense, ruined my day, sub zero and scorpion were the only good part of the movie. Absolute cringe everytime they referenced the game.","negative"
6,"Among all the movies that release each year, there are always 3-5 movies that I most look forward to. For 2021, Mortal Kombat is one of those movies. I mostly anticipated how Warner Bros. Was going to bring this universe of characters back to life.This movie was short considering that it is under two hours in length. I believe that it was done to play it safe and jump right to what probably most audiences want to see, the fights. Do not get me wrong, I absolutely appreciate an action-packed sci-fi movie. But I also do desire strong character build. The issue with this movie's length is that it can only allow so much development and growth in the characters. Both sides had at least 6-7 characters to be familiar with, and that is too many characters to connect with in under two hours. Among all the villains in the movie, only two had any type of character development. Sub-Zero had the most development, and he was followed by Kano. From all the champions or defenders of Earth, Cole Young was the only character with focused development.Scorpion too had some character build, but I felt he really deserved a much bigger presence. The movie gave the impression that his character was going to have a similar story presence to the 2020 animated movie Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge.It is time to move on to the fighting. Each fight was shorter than what I would like to watch, but each fight was mind-blowing in its own way. One thing that Warner Bros. Really nailed right was the character cast and their acting/fighting abilities on the big screen which mirrored the characters in the video games. The one character that most impressed me was Max Huang's Kung Lao. Kung Lao's introduction brought me to the edge of my seat because it was so unexpected. The one fight that I most enjoyed was Scorpion vs. Sub-Zero; I like both characters, but I have always been a fan of Scorpion and his Shirai Ryu ninja clan. The movie was inevitably leading to these two fighting to the death, both fights between the two met all my expectations.If Warner Bros. Continues this story in the future, I hope that it provides more appropriate connection between the characters and the audience. Each current cast member depicted his or her perspective charter exceptionally well, and I would hope to see each return. Moreover, if they do continue this series and introduce Johnny Cage, can you please cast Chris Evans to play him?","negative"

1,"This movie very bad
Mortal Kombat game is best fighting game.The fight scenes were great but the actors and effects were very bad
In the film, the game was ridiculed.I want a serial reconstruction.","negative"
3,"I watched this movie with my brother and we were both upset about it. We have both watched the previous movies before and played the games. This movie is edited so weirdly and the story is stupid. Cole is the dumbest character they added on to this movie. Kano is probably the best part. This movie is so dumb when they try to explain the dragon tattoos and how they get their powers from it. The movie had so many bad edits in it that had me shaking my head wondering what the hell was going on. Don't recommend it. Watch Scorpion Revenge or the Original Mortal Kombat Movie if you want a fun experience. Heck just play the video games.","negative"
10,"Honestly gave it a higher rating because I know how people are on here. I'd say it's a solid 6.5/7 out of 10. This movie is meant to set up the actual tournament, serving as a ""pre-tournament"" storyline. The opening sequence was AMAZING, the fighting choreography was epic, the cinematography was gorgeous the sets were good and the pacing was fast but great. The character development was virtually non-existent, but I'm sure they anticipate building some of that up in the next movie(s). The writing could've definitely been better along with some awkward acting scenes, but I didn't expect much in the first place- some of the jokes worked. I hope it does well and we get more MK films.","positive"

6,"It's passable for general audience but mortal kombat fan should've gotten more. The cast is a split bag for every good thing about them there's something wrong with them. Firstly Cole while not horrible is still boring and unnecessary many of the scene that could been use for Sonia, Kano and others are being spent on him and his family with a really stupid justification for his importance. He's a failed MMA fighter but he's has to find his inner power to success in the tournament. They really try to make care about him the whole film but you just don't. Every fan will say the same thing that he's pointless. The characters in this franchise there's no reason for you to make one up at all. It's quite obvious that Cole is taken Johnny Cages Place from the fact that he's the one who fights Goro. Which is unacceptable for the character who's suppose to be the introduction to this world for the audience Johnny cage is the most suitable for that task this movie did not need cole. The only one more pointless then Cole is Raiden who doesn't do a damn thing in this movie. This is the god of thunder & the protector of earthrealm but he doesn't do anything of motivation the fighters. You even wish for him to say I must consult the elder gods but doesn't do that. Lui Kang and Kung Lao aren't introduced for about 40 minutes. Lui Kang is shafted as the chosen one in favor of Cole. He gives speeches of wisdom basically taken raiden job but he's not that shaolin master with that Bruce lee mentality from the games. Kung Lao, who usually overlooked by Lui Kang actually gets more respect in this movie overshadowing him which is a nice Change of pace for him. Kano's great the comic relief he's crude and vulgar hands the best portrayed in the movie. Though I wish that he had his cybernetics that's his thing. Sonia starts off as good but is absent from the fighting most of the film they add this ridiculous rule that only one's with with the dragon mark can fight in mortal kombat they bring it up multiple times and comes off rather disrespectful to her character. She also explains to Cole want mortal kombat is as if she and Jax would know that before meeting raiden. Both her and Jax you don't really know anything about them.similar to Mortal kombat: Scorpions revenges they just expected you to know these people. Lastly the opening with Scorpion and subzero if your looking forward to a whole movie of them your going to be disappointed it's not the tone for the whole movie. The fighting scenes are great their nicely choreograph and of course the gore is a beauty.however the duels between the come back that's all seem rather rushed and pushed more towards the end and when they start there over rather quick. They should've space the Fight out more and had more action. The music good and the effects are good especially on Subzero. This film takes a ton of liberties not saying that they had to rehash the same plot of mk1 with the island tournament but this world is not developed. There is no rule interference of the mortal kombat. You don't know anything about the other realms or the elder gods. Mileena is just there with no Mention of Kitana its out of place. While you see images of Shao khan in the film he's not even mentioned by name! You don't see any location of outworld but derserted landscape. They don't really say who Shang Tsung is he's really generic. You don't really see him as a threat at all. The shaolin temple's a ruin with no culture to it doesn't feel like a place where white lotus Shaolin monks are born. The movies a fun take of franchise while not great it does have something to offer and how this movie ends we most likely will be getting a sequel. If It wasn't for Kano the movie would've been worst.","negative"
6,"Keep the first 15 mins and the last 10 mins and literally throw all the rest away.I feel as if this movie was directed vy two people , hence the massive curve in quality between start , mid and end.Giving such a highly anticipated title to a first time director and writer shows right through the movie .As far as acting goes , apart from the excellent scorpion and subzero as well as Jax and mileena , everyone else does not know how to act at the level this movie needs to be.Very dissapointing in general .... a missed oppourtunity .","negative"

2,"Okay, the new Mortal Kombat movie is a MEGA HUGE letdown. If I had to rate it, I would rate it 2 stars out of 10 - its that bad. 1 star for the back-story for Sub-Zero and Scorpion, and 1 for the graphics. Other than that, EVERYTHING sucked, even the characters (that aren't Sub-Zero and Scorpion) - and those two aren't my favorite character(s) from the original. Don't waste your 2 hours.","negative"
3,"Nothing campy or fun just spiteful and awkward interactions. No coherent story, character arcs or continuity towards original material. No distinctive sets or character design. I couldn´t draw one silluette or set outline from memory. Adding their own plain and unrelatable main character while others are missing. Uncomfortable undertones of ""white"" man bad. I guess that´s what happens when you are too busy checking boxes from some data sheet to actually tell a compelling story. CGI team did a good job. Glad I didn´t pay anything. Sad to see it.","negative"
4,"Let's face it, this movie sucks. There is no tournament style setting. Boring pointless main character who isn't even in the games. Scorpion and Sub Zero costume design was bad. Acting was terrible. Even the cgi was bad. All in all this movie fell short in every aspect. The only redeeming quality was that some, not much but some, of the fight choreography was decent (first scene)","negative"
4,"Mortal Kombat 2021 is disappointing. It is clear the director didn't have a passion for the source material. The film does have great special effects, however the plot of the film and overall pacing is unforgivable. The fights scenes did introduce some new elements but are rushed with no suspense or real consequence. The movie finishes abruptly to setup a sequel but in the end it is just a kick in the face to fans of the MK mythology.","negative"

4,"People giving this movie a 6+ needs to surely either evaluate their tastes or look deep within themselves to understand what they like in movies. Mortal Kombat Annihilation from 1997 was as cheesy as they come and I can swallow and appreciate the tropes that that movie made compared to the tropes of this one. The post covid sets with the inclusive cast mixed with the marvel universe non-serious humor really left a bad taste in my mouth.The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that they had to find their ""Arcana"" which is some fantasy power move like a Marvel superhero similar to Animality from the 97' MK movie. This movie was a mess with the very small portion of cool video game reference scenery that would make people cheer.Funniest plot idea to me was that they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE TOURNAMENT. Yes, you heard me. They never got to the tournament, its only fighting the ""bad guy"" before the tournament (Which is against the rules) and Rayden choosing to let it happen because of the Elder gods rules. Which ultimately leads to Kung Lao's death (again). Then when Rayden is asked why did he let it happen, he said because he cannot help all souls of Earthrealm. Yet, he is willing to let, ya know, one of his prized fighters on earthrealm die to someone who is killing him outside the rules of the tournament.... Nice.Overall just bad movie. I don't care about the video game accuracy or the cheesy one liners or the bad CGI at certain parts. But this was just a poor movie in almost every aspect and it took energy out of me to watch the rest. This is a fan theory Mortal Kombat with failed college projects vibes to the editing and directing.","negative"
10,"This is easily the best Mortal Kombat movie ever! It has great action obviously, fantastic characters/costumes, jaw dropping fatalities, and really funny dialogue as well. It is a kick ass time at the movies and is better than the 1995 version in every way except Shang Tsung, and he was still really good in this new movie. I have already seen it four times. Everyone go watch it!P.s. - If you like the lore and characters in this film check out the animated movie Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge.","positive"
10,"Great movie, definitely lived up to its reputation. The action, fight scenes and story line was 10/10. I don't think Cole is going to be a big character in the franchise, so I think the sequel should have less attention on Cole and focus on what the audience wants and that's their mortal kombat characters come to life on the big screen. Otherwise the movie was great and I enjoyed every second of it. The Tournament is about to begin. Well done to all the people who made this movie and well done to all the actors for their brilliance on the big screen.","positive"

5,"This movie is less then average. Fight scenes were good? Are you kidding me? Watch Boyka... The movie is predictable and nothing new. The rating of 5 must suffice, and also only for the past admiration of MK... It is a one view movie. The acting after Sanada is also less then average... The CGI is nice, but does not make a good movie...","negative"

10,"I will be short. You should understand how hard to make movies based on such a legendary universe (expectation is too high!), with a lot of characters that need screen time, and with limited budget, PLUS in a pandemic situation, - the director made a great job.This is the best adaptation of such a legendary title.","positive"
10,"I'm not an action movie kinda girl, but I've always been a mortal kombat fan! This movie brought my entire childhood to life. My favorite character was definitely sub zero! I wish they would have had quan chi or shinok instead of tsang Tsung. Kano was kinda annoying. But the gore and the fatalities are beyond perfect. LOVED it.","positive"
2,"I'm giving it 2 stars for the costumes & CGI, and that's where it ends. I was so completely disappointed with this latest iteration of Mortal Kombat, I don't know where to start. I have followed the Mortal Kombat films since the first one in 1995, and by far, after 26 years, that is way better than this 2021 version, though we've come a long way with technology. And if you've never followed the films, some of the character's names won't be familiar to you.One of my favorite characters is Liu Kang. In the other films he was a serious bad-a** warrior and martial artist. This Liu Kang looked and acted like a young new-age flower child left over from the 60's. Louis Tan as Cole Young is just not a very good actor and his character was getting his butt whipped at every turn. If you're descended from the bloodline of a Ninja warrior, then for goodness sake, act like it. That character was so badly written, it was laughable. And his family...who cast them? They all looked like siblings; older brother, middle sister and younger sister. None of it was believable that this was his wife and kid. And can we talk about Subzero....he was always a character you loved to hate, yet with this Subzero, he was more irritating than anything else. The Scorpion acted as if he was just out of all his martial arts gas...his tank was empty, and his famous catchphrase ""get over here!"" landed with a thud. Raiden was like your cool uncle that can always make you feel better even when he knows you're a screw-up. This character was the most tolerable of them all.And there were characters with hardly anything to do such as Mileena, with a mouth like a monstrous man-eating Venus fly trap...why? Nitara...if you blinked you'd miss her. Then they took the Black guy Jax, had his arms frozen off and made him into something that looked like a cyborg, once again...why? And where was Kitana, who was a major character in the other films and the twin sister to Mileena? But ultimately, there was no tournament (which is at the core of the Mortal Kombat films), no real character development, no insightful explanation of the prophecy and the writers didn't make good use of the source material....this was another glaring example of Hollywood screenwriters and the powers-that-be fixing what wasn't broken.","negative"
1,"Lets start with the main character, Cole, who was a completely unnecessary character who added nothing to the movie. It was actually insulting that they had to add a audience character to the story as if we couldn't grasp the ""deep and complex"" story that Mortal Kombat isn't known for, pretty sure we can all figure out who the original characters are of Mortal Kombat by now. Cole never even grew as a character and just got angry? Coles ""special power"" was completely lame and looked like a cheap rubber suit on screen. They literally gave armor to a character that had plot armor, kind of Ironic and ridiculous. The Scorpion story was completely unnecessary and adding nothing to the story and never really touched based with later in the film. Goro was in the film for a few minutes and it was an completely underwhelming fight and introduction to the series. All the other characters were mediocre at best and didn't really make the film. The ending was super underwhelming and didn't even end up having a tournament. The 95 version far exceeds this movie. Go watch that one.","negative"

6,"Not sure why newb filmmakers (writer, director) tackled such a big production, but their lack of experience shows. It was slickly made, but hollow. Poor cast direction made almost every actor look amateur. The story was bland and too long with lots of filler and little substance. Don't get me started on the huge plot issues and convoluted scenes. The action and gore scenes were the only positives.","negative"
4,"This whole movie was filled with ""Mortal Kombat"" one liners that were poorly acted out and preformed. This movie missed the mark by a long shot. I found myself on my phone for over half the movie. This is not a movie to watch more that once, out of pure pity.","negative"
5,"If it would be an independent movie with its own universe, I would definitely give it a higher score. But it tries to be a part of well established MK Universe. But it does so by completely disrespecting MK lore. For example:
1. Jax lost his arms to Ermac, not Bi Han.2. Everything suddenly becomes based on MAGIC, despite Sony, Kano, Jax etc. Abilities were always based on technology.3. Reiko is shown as a mindless brute despite in the lore he is actually smart and cunning.The list can go on and on. Furthermore, the story itself seems poorly developed, like just a beginning of a movie rather than a whole movie.","negative"
3,"Mortal Kombat (2021, Simon McQuoid)
'Mortal Kombat' becomes the lates in the high profile films of 2021 being released on HBOmax on the same day that they drop in theaters. I am in no way any kind of Mortal Kombat aficionado. I played the game a bit when I was younger and have no real memory of the 90's adaptation therefore I do not take any fanboy sensibility into this review although I do recognize some of the characters and the catchphrases from the game sprinkled throughout. This is director McQuoid's feature debut and he certain gets to play with some toys as this is a heavily effects based martial arts film. I feel like they tried too hard to construct a plot around the characters and concept of the game although it still comes across like a half hearted effort as far as script and plot go. This is a solid R rated film which allows them to fill the movie with some gratuitous violence and bloodletting which is in keeping with the harsh uberviolent nature of the video game which caused a sensation when it was first released.The plot sets up a classic hero's journey in the form of Cole Hanzo who is not a character from the game I believe. He is a faltering mixed martial artist but quickly learns that he is descended from an elite fighting ancestor and he has been selected for a supernatural tournament where no less than the fate of Earth hangs in the balance. Earth's champions are all identified by distinctive dragon marks. The beings of what is known as Outworld have their own champions primary among them being an otherworldly entity known as Sub-Zero. Like I said the plot here is thin yet overly convoluted. It actually would have been better to attempt less plot to just get to the fighting. I will give them credit for gore though. They had an R rating and they wielded it with a reckless abandon. The first fight involves a thrilling battle as our protagonist, Cole Hanzo's, ancestor whips around a blade tied to a rope wasting bad guys left and right. Another standout scene is one where Sub-Zero utilizes his freeze powers in a battle to amazing effect. It is a very cool scene where even his blood becomes a weapon. Our hero, who is initially beset by self doubt, finds his strength, channels the power of his ancestors and with the help of the other champions of Earth defeats the evil Outworlders. One of the oddities of the narrative is that there was supposed to be this big tournament known as Mortal Kombat, but the Outworlders were trying to cheat by killing Earth's champions so we never even got to the tournament. It was kind of an odd way to take the story, but I think they just didn't want to do a basic fighting tournament story.The special effects and the fighting make, for the most part, this movie an entertaining watch. The plot is just a cobbled together mush to give the character's excuses for fighting. The shame is that they actually seemed to try to put together this plot and storyline and it winds up being silly and ultimately the downfall of the film. You don't get invested in any of the character's despite the film imploring you to, and even the tease at the end of assembling a new group of champions including Johnny Cage only really causes a smirk rather than generate any kind of genuine excitement for a sequel. This film isn't awful, but it is far from good. Ultimately this may be destined to be one of those cult style faves beloved by a few and chided by many. I enjoyed a few of the fight scenes and appreciated the R rating but was hoping for much better than what was delivered.Eric's Grade: D+","negative"

So this should really be her review... because I'm just going to trash it.The problem here is plot, as in they actually tried to add in a real plot. Mortal Kombat is a fighting game. You play it to peacefully beat your friends to a bloody pulp... and that is where the fun is.But they added a plot.In Twister, the star of the show was the tornado. The plot was there to move the view from tornado to tornado. And in Back Draft, it was the same... with fire.Mortal Kombat thought it had to be deep. It thought it had to be something more than it a tournament. It thought the characters had to have more than surface level depth.THE DIDN'T.The Tournament should have been the star. The plot should have only been there to move you from fight to fight with a climax that shouted ""FATALITY!"" and left it at that.Instead they tried to add depth where no depth was needed... and that killed the fun of Mortal Kombat.Not every movie needs to have a plot and characters, some movies work best as mindless popcorn munching escapism.","negative"

There is good character development and sparks of originality in the plot to keep things interesting. If you're a fan of classic kung fu movies or the game you will definitely enjoy this film. ""Finish him!""","positive"
4,"This movie isn't that great. The plot is really forgettable, most of the characters aren't as good as I expected, the fighting is the only positive aspect of this movie which saves it from getting a 2 star rating.If you like wasting your time watching this mess, then go ahead and watch it.","negative"
3,"I watched this film with a bunch of guys that are very familiar with the Mortal Kombat universe and games. As far as faithfulness to the source material, the film does a great job of stuffing the action full of game references and one-liners that are sure to make fans of the franchise smile.However, as a film, this is god awful. There is absolutely no sense of pacing whatsoever; the film moves at a blistering pace. The plot is almost non-existent. Instead there are lots of action sequences in which the CGI looks a little shoddy. The lack of plot may not bother others, but there are so many unexplained sequences in the film that at some point you have to shrug your shoulders and just enjoy the action sequences that have been put together. The acting is pretty bad, the dialogue is worse, and the movie ends with no story arc.It's a fun watch for making fun of the film or chilling with a bunch of your friends. Beware though - this movie sucks!","negative"
10,"Just finished watching it and had SO MUCH FUN, they were NOT kidding when they said it was gonna be borderline NC-17, it DELIVERED on the blood, guts, and gore and the fight scenes were SO BRUTAL too lol. Fellow MK fans are gonna have a blast with this, it is a gore soaked nonstop action thrill ride and total adrenaline rush right to the end; if I had any complaints at all, it's that I would've liked to see bi-Han (the OG sub-zero) turn into noob saibot and even would've liked to see ermac and baraka and I was REALLY hoping to see sub zero rip out somebody's spine, but other than that, I had a great time and am ready for the sequel now.","positive"
10,"This is a dream come true movie for Mortal Kombat fans. Can't get any better version than this one. It's brilliantly done. Every single character gave their best.","positive"
5,"Who is Cole ?How could he defeat Goro !!!! With a vest ?! No no
the movie felt like a short fan movie
fight scenes are slow and people get killed quickly
Raiden can teleport people ?! So why doesn't he teleport one enemy with all fighters to finish him quickly?Kano dialogue was good and better than the whole plot
I wished this movie wasn't a prequel movie at least show the tournament like 95 movie. Or make a good sequel to the 95's one
95's story was better and the music was amazing that this one
again Cole and his family took a major screen time .. who is Cole again ?>","negative"
10,"I was waiting for this movie for long time, expectations was pretty high, I was also impressed by trailer and just watched the movie itself ,
I think they did a pretty good job overall, but don't expect too much of a story here,
Little spoiler: the best scene is fatality by Kung Lao( it was freaking awesome)","positive"

1,"This...""movie"" has so many wrongs...1)MK has so many characters,why create a new one?A loser who can't fight and suddenly defeats one of MK's greatest fighters(Goro)?And is he the protagonist?2)You can earn the MK mark if you kill another fighter who already has it?3)Kung lao died very early.4)Poor special effects.5)Scorpion´s son?6)Soundtrack?This movie is disrespectful to fans of a franchise over 20 years old.True fans will hate.Young people will not understand.","negative"

2,"Seems like people are giving this high ratings just because it has violence in it. The old movie from the 90's didn't have a single drop of blood in it and still managed to be a better Mortal Kombat movie than this crap.Plot is absolutely horrible. It's incredible to see how professional hollywood writers, people who get paid tens of thousands of dollars to make this, can take a dumb plot from a 30 year old videogame and somehow manage to make it worse. Not to mention everything is delivered in such a corny way by a cast who can barely act.This movie look like what would happen if an AI was trying to make a stereotypical bad hollywood videogame adaptation.Butchered storyline and characters? Check.Protagonist is a movie-only character who barely fit in the universe, while other beloved characters are thrown to the sidelines? Check.Horrible acting? Check.Random lines and nods from the game that makes you cringe? Check.And on top of everything, the action also sucked. The fight scenes were so badly directed, full of continuity errors and weird cuts, with sometimes the characters being at a differente spot in the scenary than they were in the previous scene.Even if you're not familiar with the source material and wouldn't be bothered by their ""reimagining"" of the story, this is just a bad movie. Badly acted, poorly written and badly directed. Skip this one.","negative"
10,"Ok so it wasn't the greatest movie ever but I expected much less to be often . It's only the first one so the budget wasn't as big as it should be . I reckon If it gets a sequel I think it will be amazing !!!! Well done guys I loved it !","positive"
10,"After the disappointment of MKA, I'm glad to say this is great.","positive"
3,"I was excited for this movie to see if it could possibly be better than the original from 95 and while the gore is there, it's not. There is little to no build up and then BOOM they are all just fighting, Not actual tournament style, the movie focuses more on Scorpions bloodline as well as the beef between him and Subzero which is cool and all but he and Subzero are not what we recall. Goro looked like he did in the original which was nice but yea the fight scene and way he died, not digging it, it wasn't even Johnny Cage. They didn't even fight out outworld, they jumped all over and it was just...yea noI mean it's an okay movie but compared to the original, doesn't come close, there are somethings that shouldn't be attempted to be remade and this most assured was one of them. The ending implied that they would continue on with the ""saga"" but I'm not hopeful.","negative"
8,"Is the movie perfect? NO. It's it entertaining? Definitely.Ask yourself so you watch a movie named Mortal Kombat for Character Development and plot? No, You watch it Amazing Fights and Fatalities. That's where this movie Succeeds. This movie also corrects the flaw of not featuring Scorpion and Subzero.","positive"
8,"This was cool and fun to watch! Has humor and cool fighting scenes that incorporated the original arcade game well! Glad I have it a chance after the other failed attempts in this franchise's past.","positive"
10,"I have read a lot of reviews being unsatisfied by this movie not sticking to the original duology which lead the reviewer pretty much devastated pretty similar to Star Wars fans and how they compare everything to the first released trilogy but this is entirely not the case on how to base the judgment .The first duology was based on the first three installments of the game which had an underdeveloped story line and different mythology to how the game evolved later on . Adopting same story line as of the first three installments of the game would cripple the appearance of the extra characters that fill up the additional game installments that took over the main lead for both sides of the realms .This movie acts as ""Origins"" of the whole mythology and how characters managed to acquire their magical abilities despite being merrily humans .As per the evolved mythology the next installments should cover the attempts of the outworld to invade earth realm by force as they failed to own it by combat and later the bias of elder gods and taking sides escalating things into resurrections and changing sides between characters leading some of the chosens to fight for outworld later .Now as a fan of the game I see the shift to the evolved mythology a healthy thing and may require patience than rather instant bash from the die hardies that want to see characters such as Lou Kang assuming the lead once more where I hate to break it to you but believe it or not in the evolved mythology Johnny Cage happen to take up the lead , Lou happens to change sides and new Sub Zero happens to join earth realm so I believe that the authors are holding a good grip of events a hopefully wont be easily pushed to revert to the under developed ancient mythology .So people behind this new trilogy , you are doing good and in difficult times , so keep up the good work and looking forward for the upcoming one !","positive"
1,"The Good: Okay fight choreography. Diverse cast. Gore (not enough IMHO).The Bad: Acting, FX, script (was this written by overexcited 12 year olds for overexcited 12 year olds?), messy and poor characterisation, no mysticism (only Arcarna that are ""superpowers"" WTF, is this a CBM?), no stakes or threat, average cinematography, and inconsistent tone. Hell, the whole movie is like a TV movie?! It's like they didn't even try.The Verdict: Too hammy to be taken seriously and takes itself too seriously to be any REAL fun. Stick with Paul W. S Anderson's 1995 effort-- Goro looks better (than some Orc-reject) and it's more ""Enter The Dragon"" than this ""Percy Jackson & The Golden Hard-R"". The last time I SMDH this badly was ""Late Night"" and the dire ""Ghostbusters"" reboot of 2016. Seriously, avoid this and play any of the MK games (even MK3) instead for 2 hours-- you'd have a much better time.","negative"
1,"I have a special place for Mortal Kombat in my heart. Besides being my favourite videogame series, its 1995 adaptation happens to be my favourite film as well. The original movie taught me many things including the discovery of my love for martial arts, mysticism, asian culture and exotic locations. The announcement of a brand new interpretation of the source material has been on a rocky road since it was announced a couple years ago and finally after a long period of silence, ""Mortal Kombat"" (2021) is ready to hit the big screen once again.Story: It is evident that Greg Russo's and Dave Callaham's main purpose for developing a new MK film was to slap an R-rating forgetting how rich the established mythos is or what the fans really like and want (besides gore). Following to the letter the (infamous) leaked script, they are making amateur mistakes: they introduce a new character that has nothing to do with the franchise as a vessel that is being dumped copious amounts of exposition; they take further liberties with the material by having our heroes unlocking their potential superhuman fighting abilities which mangles an already overpopulated plot that is plagued with gigantic plotholes. These ideas are the weakest aspects of a rather lame attempt to bring the MK world to life. Cole Young (the new guy) is so blunt that derails the attention from the main attractions (i.e., the other more interesting characters) with a shoehorned family backstory that further lengths the running time and disabling any tension.The script tries to balance too many characters with little to no explanation as to who they are along a steadily increasing pace that halfway through you lose interest (even when they are fighting) because there is really no emotional pay off. Instead of bringing some much needed dramatic heft and verbal counterpoint, the tournament story is scrapped by having Shang Tsung attacking Raiden's headquarters - resulting in simultaneous fights leaving no room for natural progression to understand these proceedings. The script is so messy that we are not even geographically oriented.The inclusion of an overly serious tone damages the film stripping its story from you know...any fun (despite some forced jokes). Attempting to keep things grounded in a similar fashion with what Nolan did with his Batman trilogy, this ""Mortal Kombat"" is an exercise to futility. A desaturated mess of lore, new concepts, and characters that barely have something to say and even less to do. There is no dramatic tension, and no special obstacles to overcome followed by a sense of ""let's wrap things up"" in a boring climax that instead of awe, you get a yawn. There is nothing memorable on a visual level, or a banal moral example demonstrating the unfamiliarity with the material from the screenwriters' part.Direction and action: Simon McQuoid is clearly inexperienced in shooting a film. He is unable not only to extract any meaningful or playful performances (as opposed to the '95 flick) but also incompetent at shooting action. There are myriads of cuts and close ups during the numerous (but surprisingly short) fight sequences that betray this sentiment coupled with rather embarrassing CGI (both blood and creature) effects. After the ""Raid"" (having in a way better role Joe - Subzero - Taslim) and ""John Wick"" series demonstrated incredible practical stunt work and real time fighting, ""Mortal Kombat"" pales in comparison with atrocious editing that tries in vain to masquerade inexperienced actors, slow movements and shoddy CGI environments which is even worse when an experienced to martial art movies cinematic eye catches a glimpse. The fights lack any visual flair that made the original's sequence a joy to watch which is not helped by poor cinematography and uninspired small sound stages. Despite some initially promising results at the village fight (which is still plagued by bizarre editing choices; used the same shot twice!) helped by Taslim's athletic abilities, the film sinks like Titanic. Every fight becomes shorter and less interesting lacking any visual innovation or grittiness - fighters like Mileena, Reiko, Kabal, Jaxx, Goro, Nitara and Kung Lao offer nothing more than a couple of moves.Cast: To be fair to the cast, they do seem dedicated in their roles but their uncertainty as to how they should approach this material (and those lines) is telling while their chemistry is non existent. Excluding Josh Lawson (as the typical profanity loving Aussie douchebag Kano) who is clearly having a ball with the material and attempts to steal the show (maybe too much sometimes), the rest are torn between embracing the material or reject it.Ludi Lin (Liu Kang) has no presence (he is tiny) and from main character status (in the game), he is being reduced to a secondary player paling in comparison with the great Robin Shou who delivered an incredible physical performance. Jesicca McNamee looks the Sonya Blade part and has more screentime now but gets a bizarre arc of wanting to be an Earth's champion and hence staying in the sidelines for most of the time. For Lord Raiden, while Christopher Lambert knew how ridiculous the source material was and gave us a now iconic take - voice, mannerisms, dry humour - the filmmakers cast Tadanobu Asano, a decision primarily driven by ethnicity appeal rather than crafting an interesting character. Asano is playing Raiden straight, yet he does not have enough or any appropriate material to work with.But most importantly, there is no Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa. This version of Shang Tsung (Chin Han) seems to be coming from the discount store, lacking any menace, memorable lines or delivery reestablishing at how important is to have an intimidating villain that can carry the burden of the antagonist in the whole film. Instead our primary villain becomes Subzero (Joe Taslim) with his conveniently inconsistent (when the script demands) ice powers. Taslim tries his best and while he has a certain cinematic presence, his physique is not fully exploited. His hyped relationship with his opposite Scorpion (Hiroyuki Sanada) is one noted and is never explored. He is just evil (who speaks English when the scripts requires him to do so). The legendary Sanada on the other hand takes on a thankless role and similarly like Raiden is reduced to a borderline cameo.And then there is Cole with Tan proving that he does not have enough charisma to lead a film and delivering one of the most boring performances of the last ten years. The rest are just line outputs for the plot to move forward with some not even getting more than five lines!Production design and costumes: The rather minimalistic production design only makes matters worse. What could have been a tremendous opportunity to showcase unique locations around Australia for this perilous outworld, devolved into a studio shoot in the city of ... Adelaide. Despite a rather ok opening in a remote Japanese village (with one house!) in the 17th century, ""Mortal Kombat"" is packed with bizarre stylistic choices that raise an eyebrow even in the first screening (e.g., Raiden's temple has a electrical like coil at its centre, Shang Tsung's throne is an rocky elevated place that is hanging above a cliff, Reptile is an actual ... reptile). There is a distinct lack of eye candy that does not captivate our attention demonstrating a void of creativity. While the costumes are above those in ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"", they still look like expensive pieces of cosplay - particularly for those of Liu Kang, Kung Lao and Shang Tsung. Only Kabal's visual look is faithful to the source material but then again he is in there for five minutes.Music: Benjamin Wallfisch - from the school of the Hans Zimmer pompous synthesized music - is the composer failing to delivering anything interesting. Having to fill the shoes of George S. Clinton in the original (which saw the use of taiko drums, shakuhachi flutes, violas and Tivetan throat monks), Wallfisch utilizes an array of ambient electronic and percussion like sounds with no distinct personality. This results to a cacophonous score, a wasted opportunity to craft something truly blood pumping and mystical. His zimmerisms are full on display here, an ultimately vague attempt that frankly so many blockbusters are lately falling prey to. His work here is noisy and incoherent, lacking any distinct themes, rhythm or subtle moments.Special effects: Funny for a film that includes special superpowers, the filmmakers are doing their best to hold back. Besides some nifty touches on Subzero's powers (which is probably where most of their budget was spent), the remaining shots are lackluster at best. The creature effects are shoddy and unrealistic (Goro is an embarassment) while cases where our heroes or villains demonstrated their skills do not look beyond TV quality level. And the less we talk about the CGI enhanced environments, the better.Verdict: The comparisons with the '95 film are inevitable and whereas that adaptation was constantly raising the dramatic stakes with each fight allowing us to explore a different side of the Outworld, this Kombat is a monotonous and lackluster attempt to establish a new franchise. With the exception of Josh Lawson, there was nothing that I enjoyed in this film. Devoid from any fun and character, coupled with subpar acting, atrocious editing, terrible stylistic choices and an overly serious tone, ""Mortal Kombat"" is not the film you are looking for, not even for the action department. If you do like Joe Taslim see him in ""The night comes for us"" in Netflix. There are buckets of actual gore (not CGI) and actual fighting that would leave you speechless. Else seek out the original cult adaptation, enjoy Tagawa and Lambert and have a blast from the 90s!","negative"
3,"Im a fan of the game since i was a kid, and I grow up watching the first 1991 movie.I am judging this solely as a film, and why I think the film is extremely bad while keeping simple and short as possible.The plot of the film is incredibly bad, and the main protagonist, Cole Young, is a very dull and undeveloped character.I wish the studio should have just follow one of the original characters instead, because when the film begins, it shows that the film could have become a great film.Why is it bad?We are introduced to a few heroes with zero clue and not much development time for to be invested on them.The film we follows the main character name Cole Young, which the studio thought it was a great idea to add as an new original character for the film, so the viewer who doesn't know anything about MK can relate to based on his perspective.Instead Cole Young turn up to be unrelatetable, uninteresting and a waste of space.There's really nothing much we know about him, other than he's bloodline, he was a mma champion, and now days he take fights where he throw the towel for money.Do I care about him? Do I root for him? Am I interested about his backstory? No,cause it's nothing interesting about him. Is like the Goku in Dragon Ball live action, less stupidity, but more plain.The acting was just mediocre, not great, but some of the scenes are bad, and the casting is questionable.For example, Sonya Blade, isn't she an elite soldier?, an elite soldier who looks like a model. Really? Unbelievable.Liu Kang, he's character I found very awkward and humouring, mainly because he's like that dude in class who enjoy plays D&D, but no one is actually playing with him at the moment, but he's still in character. When you watch LOTR, something that set in fantasy medieval time, most of us do not question the behaviour or action or a person in that film, even thought is a fantasy film. But Liu Kang in this film is just unnatural and unbelievable acting is something can't be ignore.Also the actor for Liu Kang is so good looking, in any shot, to the point it such a distraction.Regarding to plot, and how the story progress, it was extremely rush, and we are also reminded by the characters with the simple line, ""We do not have time"". From the ambush scene from sub zero at the diner, until we meet Liu Kang at the temple, we reminded by the characters again and again.It should be note that, we are not even in the tournament yet, the whole film is about what happened before the tournament.The fact thay they making the same mistake as Spiderman 3, introducing too many villain, and also heroes, with no proper develop and delivery story, is just plain sad , the fact that people still make same mistake not learning from the past in 2021The action scene is your cliché Hollywood fight scenes, that consist of your usual fast pace fight that the camera will be cut every 4&5 seconds, nothing that memorable to me, afterall I think the best fight scene is already shown in the trailer, scorpion vs SubZero, that's it.If you're a Cinephile, it's waste of time.If you just want to see a Mortal Kombat Film, because it's a Mortal Kombat, this franchise is for you.","negative"

7,"The 2021 Mortal Kombat is probably the best of the films. The game has a lot of charm and effort as a movie based on Mortal Kombat. Maybe there can be some issues with the script that doesn't have much to offer and some of the characters aren't interesting. But the movie itself really makes up for those flaws. The backstory from the main character is engaging. The visuals and costumes have massive improvements from the 90s films. The acting is very solid. And especially intense action that makes the movie bloody and extreme like in the games. If you're a Mortal Kombat fan and you want to see an actual film based on it, this movie will have what you want. For quite some time, movies based on video games are improving from the previous ones and take them seriously as what those films really stay true to the games. And this film is one of them. Not a great film, but definitely I would take this than the ones from the 90s.","positive"
