1,"The app is good. But , Timer misbehaves like anything . I have started matches with 10-12 seconds less already for god knows what reason. I have premoved and even then timer reduces 10-12 seconds. Go for Lichess instead, there atleast the timer doesn't start till you make the first move, which is mo...Full Review"

3,"Pretty nice game, really good for teaching people how to play the basic fundamentals of chess, see when I started playing I had no clue what I was doing, it how pieces move. Since I started playing however, I have learned more complex strategies, including the queen's Gambit, the four move checkmate...Full Review"
4,"This app has a huge amount of depth, even as a free user, but doubly so if you're serious about chess and willing pay for the heaps of options for improving your game. Online matchmaking is extremely quick and smooth too. The problem I do see is the AI are all over the place in terms of difficulty. ...Full Review"

9,"Does this even need a review, it's amazing.. Works fine. But the only thing is, there could have been a few more bots to play for free, from each tier.. And there could have been some more free puzzles too. But, I won't let these things make me decrease a star from my review. The fact that this app ...Full Review"
10,"It's a fun game and the app has hardly any advert intrusion which is nice. What is annoying is how the app simply stops working when an update is available. The opponent won't move until it's updated. And I like the fact I can move the app to SD storage, but after every update (every couple of weeks...Full Review"
11,"Most definitely one of the better ones out there. But if your like me you will still want to get all the better ones. Not because this one is lacking in any way, it's not. I just like to try them all. The last major upgrade for this one was excellent. They improved the bots selection and gave them k...Full Review"
12,"This is probably one of the best chess apps you can find out there, with a large enough user base to pair you quickly, although I believe the analysis depth shouldn't be limited as much in the free version, because there are free apps available for unlimited analysis (e.g. AnalyzeThis). Also the puz...Full Review"
13,"After the last update the app has been unusable for me. I tried to respond to challenges by clicking the check, nothing happened. My internet speed is really fast but when I try to create a blitz game the ""searching for opponent"" screen only stays for a second and closes by itself. Update- the app i...Full Review"
14,"Pretty good. Way too expensive though. And there's seriously nothing more annoying than the immediate pop-up of ""victory"" or ""defeat"" instead of letting the player analyze the board. Appreciate that the free lessons are a thing, but only being able to go through a couple a week is just awful. Don't ...Full Review"
15,"Massive Potential Being Snuffed Out. Let me make one thing clear, this app helps me kill time and have fun occasionally. On the other hand, there's things about this app that kill ME. I'm a beginner chess player, so obviously I don't have any wins under my belt. I was happy to see that this app seem...Full Review"
16,"Nice app. No irritating ads for free <U+0001F41D> lovers. You can play unlimited person-to-person but there are caps on puzzles per day and lessons per week. But its actually good this way for the long term. I'm removing one star for its rating system. It uses glicko rating system which is not similar to the ...Full Review"
17,"Truly fantastic. I use the pass and play feature at school in recess, I play online with other people, I play daily puzzles to refresh my skills and I challenge friends as we are all very competitive. The app is very polished and a true treasure. It kept me busy in times I had nothing else to do. Co...Full Review"
18,"This game is awesome! You can play against people, bots, and it has trophies so u can see smthing like ur rank! Plus, it has no ads! But the only reason i gave it 4/5 is bc... The lessons, puzzles etc it includes.. Cannot be used more than 1 time per day.. You need premuim for that. But everything e...Full Review"
19,"The app and site are quite good. My issue has been with the terrible customer service I received. My issue was not acknowledged or fairly handled at any stage, only to be blocked from contacting customer support. Unbelievably unprofessional. Have requested a refund of membership fees due to the insu...Full Review"
20,"Deserves every <U+2B50> even if you only have a passing interest in Chess. Yes, you can play Chess but it can also teach you how to play (or play better) with clear guides, game analysis and puzzles. I haven't paid for premium but that offers even more besides."
21,"The only place to play against IM or GM.. lot of lessons or puzzles. There is always place even for beginner to GM, from rating of 1000 to 2800. Whatever is your level, you can always have same level opponent. A good place to improve your offline chess skill. The only con is just like another online...Full Review"
22,"Really good app, I'm a beginner to chess so the training and ""coaching"" aspects are really top notch. My only gripe holding this back from 5 stars is the fact that the app drains battery so fast. I have a Samsung Galaxy S20+ which usually is a tank for battery life. But this app sucks my batteries s...Full Review"
23,"Way too many bugs in the app. Impossible to get help as it takes them DAYS to respond and they usually just ask you to do their work for them so they can pass it on to ""developers"". Yeah....

24,"I highly recommend u this application if you want to improve at chess ! Fair match ! coceptual learning ! practice sessions ...puzzles and much more to explore here ! ( if you take membership ) but overall it's really good for people like me who want to grab free things often ! ;) thanks developers ...Full Review"
25,"An excellent game for chesslovers. I love playing chess, but unfortunately I can't carry my board in all the places, so I tried mobile chess, but many of the applications I used were not comprehensive. Then I installed this, and guess it's one of the finest application I installed on my mobile."
26,"I loved the app when it was working and basically played every day. However, something changed and now the app will not connect me to any other players, so I cannot play anyone anymore. If this gets fixed, I'd rate the app 5 stars because I love the analysis, the puzzles, and the lessons."
27,"Great way of improving your game and learning new strategies and openings. Excellent gameplay with others from all over the world of a similar level to yourself. So many variations and for every skill level."
28,"Excellent game that is chalk full of learning tools, instructions and tutorials. Play against AI, play a friend, or play online. I want to play. Data galore and analysis all around. Improve your game with this app."
29,"You guys really dropped the ball when you changed the after game analysis. I had paid for a subscription which for any app or service is rare for me the way it was before. Now I definitely would not pay for a subscription. The move by move analysis you had made amateur chess players think learning c...Full Review"
30,"While playing, the opposite players are disconnecting their network to stop the time countdown and they are thinking. It's not fair and you have to code like if total network disconnected time greater than 1 minute, the person should lost the game. Otherwise all the players would do the same like of...Full Review"
31,"So this game is SUPER great with the online ability AND the bots, but one of the biggest problems is that it randomly ""Draws"" a game by stalemate? Like I'll have an easy and clear set up to win and it just draws the game so I don't get the points :/ other than that, tho, it's a super amazing app!"
32,"All notifications are turned on, nothing has changed, but when I returned to the app after some time notifications no longer have sound! I also don't see the invitation popup for a new game sometimes."
33,"No refunds and if you downgrade memberships... They keep money for rest of year for other plan... That's fine if you let me keep the features until then... Instead you get downgraded immediately although you paid for a particular membership for a term. Broadcasts are tricky to navigate and could be ...Full Review"
34,"just fantastic. really almost too good, the button to start a new game pops immediately and with billions of people playing at a time (I assume, what else is there to do) matchmaking is instantaneous. super addicting."
35,"I wish i could show a picture. But i have been encountering a bug with computers. Where if a move a pawn two squares up somehow the enemy pawn takes it as if the pawn i moved only one square up. Example being. I move pawn f6 as black and enemy pawn takes and moves gxf5. I'm getting annoyed at it. Ot...Full Review"
36,"It's a great app, works like a charm and helps you to step up your plays. But since this new update I haven't connected with another person, as in It's not finding any other players. As soon as that's fixed, however, ill change this to five stars!"
37,"it has introduced me to the game of chess and I'm loving it so far ! it's very informative, the drills are practical and the competition is good. the lessons they provide are very insightful too."
38,"I love this app. It's great for analyzing games played against others both human and computer. The immediate feedback on your moves is super useful and helps the player grow in skill at an alarming rate. Instant and specific feedback on every move really helped me know where to focus on and improve."
39,"Great chess app. Very educational and fun. Although I'm using the free version, it's still very helpful especially if you are not playing chess on a very higher level. if you are, I'll advise you to get the full version."
40,"Ive only had this for like 40 minutes and there is a extremly annoying thing people will do if your close to beating them. They will leave. they wont give up or neither just act like a normal person and play till the end they leave for what i assume is making sure you get no points or because they a...Full Review"
41,"The game is amazing and all ... A 2 player mode will be easy to add i think ... But my only problem is there is this nerve wrecking bug where let's say i have a pown at d7 ... Computer has a pown at e5 ... I move mine to d5 ... Computer takes my d7 by moving his e5 to d6 ... Like why ??!!!... I lost...Full Review"
42,"No email athentication was ever sent. Can't chat or add friends. Being that is the whole reason I downloaded this. It's looking like the coders need to spend more time making sure things work right then adding in all there ads"
43,"Very good app with all the required analysis. Also We have the option of vs engine /vs human... That keeps you interested and develop your game. The puzzles are good too... Overall value for money... Cheers"
44,"Good game but the connection is not good, in the middle of the game it shows disconnected and i lose the game because of the time thats why i gave you 3 star please solve the problem as fast as you can."
45,"Automatic resign sucks, I lost many of my matches when I was about to win because of it, even the the opposite player clock is running after my move but then the app crashes and I lose by auto resign.fix this bug plz. It's irritating to lose the winning matches."
46,"Pros: Nice and stable app. Contains hundreds of puzzles, where you could train your skills. Cons: Many of them have several solutions. When I choose the better one than the authors have chosen, it considers, that I am wrong."
47,"Half of the fun comes from chatting while playing chess, today I played chess but I was not able to chat with other person, the chat section and keyboard are coming,but when I typed and enter the message is not going to other end, plz check into this problem, I really like this app if it isn't for t...Full Review"
48,"the best ever. we get to play matches, solve puzzles within a limited timeline, get daily problem, play with the bots who really train is with unlimited number of matches . I just loved this app."
49,"If you intend to grow a career in Chess with ratings and titles, this is the place to be with all basics and lessons, openings, game analysis, online opponents (including the real life Grandmasters), tournaments, and daily puzzles. You still can work it out, even if you dont want to invest dime in t...Full Review"

51,"I'm going back to lichess. this one Reduced rating from 3 to 2 stars. After playing this a fair bit (I'm a chess hack) I can quite easily beat the Aron computer player, but the next free computer player is Emir, and the rating gap goes from 700 to 1000. Aron is silly and makes a ton of mistakes. Not...Full Review"

53,"The app is all bugs, fails to connect properly with the fastest connect available in the world at my end, times out constantly and costs you time on the clock. Won't accept complaints on forums. shite."
54,"This chess game is great because it's don't had ads & it's also played offline. This chess game has many attractive themes i just loved all of them. It's has chess lessons that allow you to learn & get better if you are beginner wanted to get better at chess playing. And many more features are there...Full Review"
55,"This site is very lagging when playing bullets and ultra bullets.....time is reducing when it's opponent moves too. Lichess is far more better for bullets compared to this. This will work for only who has internet spped of 1GB per sec. This is so laggy for Bullets."
56,"Platform is good....but I *keep* getting disconnected so many times, or the other player does. Trash app. So basic to have connectivity. All my other apps stay connected. How about if a game gets disconnected you save and adjourn the game for a continuation saving position and remaining time. Bad te...Full Review"
57,"great way to learn chess. one downside is the constant beg for money by everything you do, but as a gold member myself I really recommend buying it, mostly for the analysis and the puzzles."
58,"A good game..But would be cool if people could analyse or play some puzzles for free ...after all a good game.. But a lot of toxic players afterall anyways a really good game afterall and I play it after studying or just to take a break"
59,"I love chess, and i have been playing on your website for an year now, i have played around 8000 games, but today i downloaded you app for the first time, and i hate it, the movement of the pieces is very bad .. i thought it will be better than website but it is worst."
60,"One of the third class app with worst algorithm. Time management is worst, and points destribution is worst part. And server is condemnable, frequently gets crashed even if internet is best. And the what's the use of so many updates when you can't even solve simple bug of pawn moves? If we make 2 st...Full Review"
61,"Sometimes, i don't find players - seems like a technical issue. Also, the app doesn't have option for 4-player chess yet. otherwise, i love it!"
62,"I've been playing this for a month or so and I've noticed a reoccurring problem where two pawns will be right beside each other yet the cpu opponents will move diagonally and take my piece when my piece is clearly out of the way."
63,"All and all a good service, however on Android 11 the game leaves the Home button, back button and recent apps button at the bottom making some of the buttons unusable since they are now behind system buttons."
64,"It's a great app and it's website got me intrested into chess. A complain i have is that you can't play unrated against random people, you can only play unrated against people you send game invites to. Also i dont like that you have to pay for lessons, analysis, and puzzles"
65,"Everything is ok ,I have some suggestions. 1:-chatting is quite difficult made some improvement like WhatsApp messenger etc. 2:-form chatting groups for the same region area people who are interested can join ."
66,"Great app. I just wish there would be a menu redesign, I start a game against someone so often instead of starting a game with a friend because the menus aren't very clear."
67,"This is my favorite, been using for about 4 years. only problem that I have is that it disconnect from the internet often, don't know if it's my wifi or it's the app."
68,"Not able to find opponents, the bad network indicator keeps on blinking. Internet is absolutely fine! Reinstalling fixes it. Every second day this happens. Everytime I have to reinstall"
69,"The only problem is app is not connecting to play game. Had to Uninstall and reinstall each time to make it work. The options within app are great but making it useless with app disfunction. This is happening after 17th May update. I had no issues before that."
70,"love this app. Very stable and the lessons are very helpful. Never had a single corrupted game like others I have tried. Good value for the subscription cost too."
71,"Live chess connection gets stuck and sometimes create problems, otherwise a great and addictive app. Hats off to all the developers who pulled this off, it is genuinely a marvel."
72,"I love this app, but the engine makes my phone extremely hot. Update: I tried the developer's suggestions. It's still causing my phone to run very hot, and now I have ads since I updated the app."
73,"Good app witl huge user base. Offers different modes of time control you can choose from and also some chess variants. Good puzzles and lessons. But a lot of content is locked behind a paywall."
74,"Great app but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add a ""confirm"" button before going into an online game. I've had many nasty surprises accidentally clicking on a game when I was NOT prepared for it."
75,"One of the best chess game app available in playstore but there is a limit on puzzel, learning and few other feature's access which is bit disappointing. Hope the team will make the application free in near future."
76,"Am facing an issue for the past one week. Earlier, When the opponent or I get the checkmate, the game used to hang. Now, I can't start a new game. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, failed."
77,"it's a really good program the only problem am having is that it times me out .....when it disconnects due to network failure though at times it's just too much....I find that to be annoying....."
78,"Game point of view it is good. But phone is getting too heat. Sometimes it even getting closed due to heavy heat. It is not my phone problem. It is in good state!!"
79,"This is an excellent app, it both provides a great many themes to chose from as well as great connection with other players. I would highly recommend this app to anyone wanting to play chess on the go with people around the world."
80,"Really liked the game , a clean fast experience. I do see some bugs though. Captured a video with the glitch. P.S. SOLDR CANNOT MOVE SIDEWAYS AND THEN FORWARD IN A SIGLE MOVE ;P hence 3 stars rating."
81,"In the recent update, somehow I am experiencing an issue whee the bottom functions are overlapping my main screen buttons. So can't use them properly. Please let me know if this bug is from my end or yours."
82,"Matchmaking is nonexistent. I could understand a few mad matches in a row, but every single game being outmatched for weeks straight is a bit ridiculous. Quite disheartening, not sure if I'll uninstall and find a better platform or find a different hobby for a time."
83,"I used several chess game apps before I found this. I deleted all of the others because this one is the best with an online playing option, bots to play to improve fast; lessons following your most recent game and so much more. I'm addicted and I love it!!"
84,"The BEST Chess App. Lots of ways to practice (against other players, against computer, puzzles, timed puzzles, lessons, etc). I also love that you can play in real life too, with their ""Pass and Play"" mode. Highly recommend."
85,"One of stupid things that happening. When you thinking to castle but instead you decide to move your rook and click on it, it castleling. F**king annoying. I'm so freaking mad to lose because of this. Please add some additional option, I'd rather click some extra button than lose because of that acc...Full Review"
86,"This chess game app is absolutely awesome. Everything about this chess game app is cool. Finest features and variants for Chess lover, so much weightage given to make newbies to learn good chess. Hats off to Devs. Tournaments are also there but I don't know how it works as I'm at beginner level."
87,"No words. Loving it. Superb app. Very effecient AI. Features are so cool. Everything is awesome. Just one requirement: app icon update and better colors selection for home page design. Good design is lacking."
88,"good overall. would like a 3d view & most importantly ""new games"" need a confirm screen... don't just instantly throw me into a match ur assuming I just automatically know what clicking each start game option means..."
89,"great app, no problems at all except for on the mobile version theres a big which says you're current puzzle rating on the home screen, other than that fantastic would highly recommend!!"
90,"I normally enjoy playing but for a week or so now it has been glitches so bad that I haven't been able to play. I just Uninstaller, gonna re-download and see if that fixes the issues. Although I see others complaining about the same things, so itvlooks like its not just me."
91,"one problem only, can't log in when I use VPN. This is annoying because I use it all the time. one suggestion: give more options for timeout notification on daily games. maybe multiple notifications, not just for 7 hours left."
92,"Incredible amount of users using engine and being unpunished, consistent bugs on starting a match when just opened the app. Used to pay the subscription, never again. If I play against elo 700-900 if feels the same as 1200-1300, as i have 2 accounts in those elos."
93,"Only matches worth playing are the 1 minute matches. People stall CONSTANTLY on every match and they aren't getting punished. I can't remember how many matches I've been one move away from winning just for my opponent to let the time EXPIRE because he wanted to""punish"" me for winning. 30 minute matc...Full Review"
94,"Its an ""okay"" app. Quite a few bugs, mainly when playing against the ai. It makes quite a few illegal moves. I move pawn a2 to a4 beside his pawn b4. He moves his b4 to a3 and takes my a4 pawn and it gives me a ""mistake"". Theres quite a few more, this is just the most repeatable."
95,"The app surffers one major disadvantage and that is stalling the game. I had an opponent who tried to cheese but blunder his queen, the next 7 mn was him doing nothing until the timer runs out."
96,"It's a very good application to learn chess. not only that you can also analysis your mistakes after the game and it will improve a lot your game play with time."
97,"Can't find games, just loads for ever. Update: It started loading games again, I didn't do anything to make it happen, just started working again."
98,"Hey team, The online mode does not search players at all . Works only for 2 matches and then i can never play or compete online . And i guess the latest update on 17th may 2021 messed this up . Please fix asap or revert me to older one"
99,"I started playing chess earlier this year and I love the way this app makes learning easy with all the puzzles and games available. this is very addicting. best Chess app around. <U+0001F44D>"
100,"I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. The developer for this game seems to have change certain chess rules like how the way the king should moves. The game rules work according to the developer of this game not according to what an actual chess should be."
101,"Best regards to the makers. You really helped me advance my chess skills and career to high levels. Not as good as the PC version. but better than nothing when you're on the go. I use it all the time. You won't regret your time"
102,"it's chess, with tutorials and puzzles, etc. would give 5 stars if it had all of the features of the website, such as more variants."
103,"Great app to learn chess and play with bots, friends or people from around the world. I really enjoy the lessons and puzzles."
104,"I regularly disconnect recently although I have internet. I can connect to other websites through both wifi and mobile data during the timer. Only a reinstall of the app helps."
105,"Many times it supports other player, they have 2 sec remaining and I have 10 sec but at last I loose the match , how this is possible, and with premium pack u got extra time, this is cheating , with money u buy extra help from the developers"
106,"Deserves zero stars. Extremely difficult to move pieces. No more than one premove allowed. Analysis is often wrong. Apparently the lasy few updates have completely trashed this app"
107,"Amazing chess app. Can play chess with people all around the world and with your friends! You can do daily puzzles and daily chess lessons. Thank you."
108,"Downloaded on January 1 2021 so I could learn to play chess. 5 months later and I am fairly decent at chess. Great app for learning whether you're a novice or well versed."
109,"It is lagging so much now my internet connection is fine but still once it shows game abandoned then after that it is stuck on the same page so disappointed have to restart my phone to play game again it has been happening so many time"
110,"I have trouble with the analysis board and when I play Puzzles or Puzzle Rush and make really quick moves, it sometimes says I made the wrong move but then when I do it again it works, but except that its great"
111,"I lost connection, even though I reconnected, the game was not visible. Therefore I lost by time. There should be a continuous game list!"
112,"The bots are excellent and you can play against them any time offline. I've never played against bots that feel like they have personality but these come close."
113,"There's alot to like. Easy to use & navigate, get to play people all over the globe, match up are fair & length of game can easily be changed."
114,"This is one of the best chess apps I've ever used, I gone from a 250 rating to a peak 1500 rating,I really recommend this for beginners.It doesn't just let you play with other people, it lets you learn aswell."
115,"The free version is good, but the membership is excellent. I'm really enjoying the lessons, videos and unlimited puzzles."
116,"Brilliant App. Premium is a bit pricey but all in all really well put together app with plenty of extras such as training and puzzles etc plus the analysis features are brilliant."
117,"App does not work anymore. Since 4 days or so it is not possible to find any games. The app just stays idle in the searching screen, no matter what que."
118,"Worst app, even though my net speed is good I am unable to play a single game since a day even though my brother is able to play game on his phone by using my Hotspot. And also I have updated the app regularly."
119,"Really enjoyed the game until recently every game I won never showed the victory message, just stopped the clocks, same with if I resigned. Now for the last day it has said 'invalid login token given' and won't load any games at all."
120,"Very fun and entertaining game if anyone loves the game of chess I would 100% suggest to download this but I do have a issue with the way you make friends with people they either nerver get my request or they are not able to accept my invite"
121,"This app started to behave weird in recent time( most time the app is not responding or closes immediately when I try to open- could be a app crash). Not sure if any app software update causing the issue or my phone is not supported the latest versions."
122,"The game is good. But the computer never accepts it's defeat. Everytime I am close to defeating it, when it had just a king and I had about 10 pieces, it claims it's a draw."
123,"Great app for playing chess. Easy to add a friend to play together. It's very addictive. I love playing the rapid or daily games, but there's lots of different options to choose from."
124,"Great app, the only thing it misses immediate move undo feature. Edit; I have the confirmation enabled but still undo would be nice . I think a similar product has it"
125,"really fun app, super addicting. Some of the players take it way too seriously though and once in a while the clock will mess up."
126,"Great application! Best Chess app I've ever used, but could you please update the main app icon to something more colorful and vibrant? Maybe use like a silver pawn with a green and blue squared background???"
127,"Unless you'll be cheating it's probably best to stay away from this app. It's filled with week old accounts all playing the best moves like they're grandmasters. It's just way too easy to cheat in online chess, and way too hard to catch them."
128,"The day i started playing chess in this app, there was amazing experience, but now many bugs are there, I am unable to messege anyone, niether my friends nor the opponent chess play..fix this...also i got three star against many bots, but when i reinstalled the app after update,all the stars got cle...Full Review"
129,"The back button (in app) no longer works after playing my turn in a game. I have to use the Android back button to go to the main page."
130,"Everything is good but when the player is losing I've to wait so long before it auto re-sign.. I've waited around 2 minutes. I hope that gets rectified."
