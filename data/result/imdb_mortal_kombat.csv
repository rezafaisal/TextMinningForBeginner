7,"I've seen the older movies of Mortal Kombat, and as cheesy and bad CGI as it was, the fights/tournaments, music, and plots were great. I was excited to see this new movie, and it wasn't that bad, but was still left unsatisfied. I was surprised that I fell in love with Kano; he was charming, hilarious, and prob the best character. Following him, I enjoyed SubZero and his fight scenes. Sonya Blade wasn't too bad too. One character that i had no interest in was the main guy, Cole. He was just boring and unnecessary. Even his ""power"" was....blah. I wish they had Liu Kang as the main guy, his story is more interesting. Another disappointment in this was the lack of tournaments in this movie, that was supposed to be the main plot of the whole movie. In addition, they did Goro dirty in this. His fight scene was short and missed the mark, and even though he was the big villain in the first movie, they showed him for less than 5 minutes in this one. Hopefully they bring him back somehow for a better fight in the 2nd movie. If they do, I'm excited to see my boy Johnny Cage!","positive"
7,"Great action and fight choreography as was to be expected from a movie with this title, special effects regarding characters and their abilities were also very well done especially considering the budget constraints this movie had. Storyline was predictable from the beginning and the writing itself isn't gonna win any awards, characters say their catchphrases from the games in key moments of the film, however, one big surprise for me was the character of Kano. He was the biggest and funniest comic relief character in the whole movie, constantly throwing jokes and insults at other characters. Probably one of the funniest, self aware movie characters I've seen in a long time.There are also weird editing jumps in the movie, one moment you're looking at characters interacting and in the next you're looking at something completely different. The movie suffers from a few of these, but given this is the directors first foray into the world of movie making, I'll take that L, most of the other important things were handled with care,If you know what you're getting and your expectations are right, this movie isn't gonna let you down with violence and gore, if you're expecting more then it's gonna be a letdown.","positive"
7,"I believe that I'm speaking for most fans when I say that I was expecting this to be loyal to the original storyline - a thought that the movie trailer ended right away. Instead we were presented with lots of deviations, and a sort of ""prequel"" that states a hope to build a cinematic universe around Mortal Kombat for the coming years, which don't get me wrong, is a very good thing. What I do think it's bad is the general acting - regarding some exceptions - along with character build up. Outworld characters appear to fall from the sky with little to no storyline attached to who they are and where they came from, when there was a lot to tell, especially about Shang Tsung, Mileena and Kabal. Actors playing Liu Kang, Kung Lao and particularly Raiden were close to average, along with their argument which was little to none. Kabal's voice was also not adequate to its figure. The guy's breathing through a metal mask and is stuck in an ""iron lung"" and sounds like a young wannabe highschool bully.Now the big elephant in the room, Cole Young. Adding a new character isn't that bad, but a new protagonist... that's an entire different thing. It's a very risky move, mostly because not only shatters the whole storyline, but also because a main character needs to be likeable to the general audience in order to stand. Personally, I found him closer to indifferent than good or bad, just kind of there. Fortunatly we can see that at the end, there's an intention to bring Johny Cage, who should already be present nonetheless along with Kitana (how can we have Mileena without Kitana?).Also there were some unecessary scenes, like Nitara (totally random choice by the way) literally appearing on screen just to die in the following second, following the footsteps of Rain in MK Anihalation. One way to get around that and other unsuited scene changes would be to increase the movie's lenght or simply not screening the character at all.On the upside, Kano's role is incredibly well performed and gives the movie its whole humour, bringing balance and a reality feeling to it. The fighting sequences are good, well shooted from a nice different set of angles, with a lot of movement variety. It's also noticeable they gave enourmous attention to Sub-Zero's special effects, which I think is one the best things in the movie along with some easter eggs like Shinnok's Amulet or Kitana's Fan. Goro's animation is also on a good note.Last but not least, the final standoff between Scorpion and Sub-Zero didn't let down. Very well shooted with an original choreography, and still managing to be loyal to some of the most iconic original moves from the game characters.To summarize, it's a generally well done remake. Although needing a lot of work, mostly on actor's performance and argument, has potential to set the foundations for an upcoming cinematic universe to be explored, which after all these years, MK absolutely deserves.","positive"
7,"I enjoyed MK overall, it was funny, action packed and generally quite faithful as an adaptation. The acting was also really good, with Joe Taslim as Subzero being the highlight for me. I was very disappointed however with the lack of an actual tournament, the fights were either ambush's or quick come and go brawls, there was no structure or rules, which I expected for the first mortal Kombat movie.I also didn't gravitate towards the newcomer Cole, I felt like he was unnecessary, I understand wanting to do your own thing sometimes but this was not one of those times. He also beats an iconic MK character which rubbed me the wrong way, but hopefully we'll see them again. The opening is brilliant and the second act is solid, but it's final act is very rushed and leaves you with little time to take it all in. Pretty good but not what I was hoping for.","positive"
7,"I believe I was 12 years old when the first Mortal Kombat came out at the arcades, I would stand in lines meticulously destroying my competition. Watching this movie brought back memories that I hadn't thought about since I was young . To make this short, The nostalgia was perfect, they had all the old champions with a few new mixed in..The beginning was awesome, I really thought it was going to be a different Mortal Kombat movie, However, the beginning is the only drama you see after that its all fights. WHICH WERE AWESOME, but for people looking to see some sort of drama or decent script writing it falls very short.","positive"
10,"I am not quite sure why many are going into this movie expecting some ""Grade A"" writing and pacing. This is literally a Mortal Kombat movie you know what you are going to get and it gave what was needed good entertainment and fighting and brutality. I didn't start up Mortal Kombat on my HBOMax expecting some amazing award-winning plot or writing I came for the fights and characters. I am not sure what a lot were expecting out of this its Mortal Kombat lol also the fight choreography was really well done I am not sure what in the world some are talking about.Entertaining movie and pretty much what I expected.","positive"
10,"I can say that I loved every part of the movie, even the boring parts, the story wasn't bad, although I would prefer to have Cole as a secondary character other than the main character, Would prefer to have more ninjas in the movie,(Scorpion, Subzero, Ermac, Reptile, Rain, Smoke, Noob, Jade, Kitana) but I wasn't mad about it, (well maybe reptile, I would prefer a more human reptile with powers than a actual reptile)The lack of Johnny Cage I can understand, he has a BIG personality to be introduced in a movie with so many characters, I gladly welcome him in the sequel.Kano was... Kano. The actor got 100000% the personality. I honestly couldn't think of a better portrait of the character. ON POINT! KUDOS Josh Lawson.Kung Lao and Jax were another great characters. The rest was a bit generic to be honest. But it was corny and entertaining, everything I wanted from MK.There were things that were a bit rushed like some way characters got their inner power. But all in all it was entertaining and great.Waiting patiently for a sequel.","positive"
10,"Have been playing the game since MK1. Legacy must go on.","positive"
10,"AMAZIIIIIING need the sequel and more characters :D.","positive"
10,"I'm by no means a Mortal Kombat expert but it was one of my favorite games to play as a kid, back on a Super Nintendo! <U+0001F633> But I have also enjoyed playing the newer MK games on newer devices as well. The games now are very graphic, and the movie delivers on that as well. I love that the characters say lines from the game like ""Flawless Victory"" and ""Kano wins!"" I really don't understand why anyone watching it would be upset with that. Have you guys ever even played the game? Kano was hilarious. I did want a little more from Mileena. Scorpion and Sub Zero were amazing! Great fight scenes! I'd definitely recommend this movie.","positive"
10,"Love the movie I hope they keep making more to come and they r amazing.","positive"
10,"Finally my home theater paid back. I didn't feel that pumped up since 2006 when I first saw the Transformers. And once the movies open after quarantine, I'll go twice lol.","positive"
10,"Here's hoping for a couple möte!I was entertained!","positive"
10,"I got a movie effort on what I expected. Yeah a video game. At least it had substance and is willing to go further bc there are more characters. But it established a basis. And was willing to show more.","positive"
10,"I see alot of other reviews saying that there wasn't a need for Cole and this and that. But I thought I was fantastic! I've been a fan of MK since the release of the 1st game. And everything done up to this point has been sub par to say the least. This movie, while yes having some cheese here and there and a couple plot holes and could've done this or that, I feel was a great story and very well executed. And for the addition of Cole. MK has introduced new characters all the time!. So why not introduce a new one? Especially one that helps tell the story and explain how this or that happens? Haha. All in all. I love it! Above and beyond better than the 1st 2 live action MK movies!!","positive"
10,"I belive with sequals it Will get better the story part.","positive"
7,"I don't really play Mortal Kombat or even follow the concept behind it. But even so, I enjoyed this movie. The fighting choreography is top notch! The costume, the cgi is also worth the hype. I love that they decided to make it rated R. But there's also some things that bothered me, like some bad cinematography, cheesy dialogues, and the somehow boring protagonist. The act 3 of the movie really felt rushed like the writers only had 5 minutes left to finish the script. I hope the sequel will have a better act 3.","positive"
10,"When scorpion says ""get over here"" and the mortal kombat music starts playing, that gave me chills!!!! I hope we do get the trilogy, seeing your childhood on the screen is always perfection.","positive"
10,"Oh, Mortal Kombat. I just loved these games as a kid... I still love them. I now can happily be cut in MK3 for the Sega or MK9 on PC. And when I learned about the existence of a film adaptation of this wonderful fighting game, I immediately decided to watch it. And you know, this movie captivates from the first seconds. As soon as they start to play the first chords of the legendary melody, you just blows the tower. The plot, though rustic, but quite decent. The characters are transferred quite reliably, though some of them are inserted into the film only for the sake of fan service, such as Scorpion or Sub-Zero. The plot revolves around the main trio of the series - Liu Kang, Sonya Blade and Raiden, who must defeat all their enemies and save the world. A little trite, but it is more than overlapped just beautiful battle scenes. The main villain of the film Shang Tsung performed by Chin Han came out very charismatic and memorable. In a whole the film highly good, albeit not without shortcomings. And separately I will allocate Goro whose model was made so that sometimes there was a feeling of its full realism. From me movie 10/10.","positive"
10,"As an old fart, I was surprised at how engaging this new take was. The 1995 version was good fun and this effort maintains the rage. The right mix of kung fu & fantasy. Plenty of laughs, gore, & deliciously cheesy, heartfelt moments.","positive"
10,"People on here really like""The plot wasn't coherent enough for me.""
""The acting performances didn't move me enough.""B**ch Sub Zero stabbed a dude with an ice pick, froze his gushing blood to form another weapon, and stabbed him with it again! Please people try to understand what you're coming to see a movie for before you see it.","positive"
10,"Violent and gory, just like the game! Non stop action. Great fights and a ton of blood. Nicely paced and I love that it harkens to parts of the game. You'll love it!","positive"
7,"The good: the story mostly works, the characterizations are insanely good (from costumes to personalities), and the movie is as gory and brutal as needed, actually way funnier than expected, and the CGI for the powers really great.The bad: the story is a bit messy, the characters motivations and reactions not always 100% natural and/or coherent, and the action and fights (with the exception of the ones with Scorpion) are fine, but the choreography and/or filming is kind of weak (easy to improve with a bigger budget and more talent on board).","positive"
10,"As a young child I loved the original movie! Watching it last night with my son, reminded me how great these fight scenes are. My son kept wanting more and when characters performed their moves and fatalities, he kept jumping out of his seat. Story could have been better but I see it's for the sequel (I hope they make soon). If you love action, this movie is for you!","positive"
10,"Amazing! Everything is excellent and great!I thought that it would be medium, but it was excellent.","positive"
